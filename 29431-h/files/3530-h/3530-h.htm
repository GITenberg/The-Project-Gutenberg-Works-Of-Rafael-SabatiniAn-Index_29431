    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. VOX POPULI
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the valley, borne aloft on the wings of the evening breeze, rose
      faintly the tolling of an Angelus bell, and in a goat-herd&rsquo;s hut on the
      heights above stood six men with heads uncovered and bowed, obeying its
      summons to evening prayer. A brass lamp, equipped with three beaks, swung
      from the grimy ceiling, and, with more smoke than flame, shed an
      indifferent light, and yet a more indifferent smell, throughout the
      darkening hovel. But it sufficed at least to reveal in the accoutrements
      and trappings of that company a richness that was the more striking by
      contrast with the surrounding squalor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last stroke of the Ave Maria faded on the wind that murmured
      plaintively through the larches of the hillside, they piously crossed
      themselves, and leisurely resuming their head-gear, they looked at one
      another with questioning glances. Yet before any could voice the inquiry
      that was in the minds of all, a knock fell upon the rotten timbers of the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; exclaimed old Fabrizio da Lodi, in a voice charged with relief,
      whilst a younger man of good shape and gay garments strode to the door in
      obedience to Fabrizio&rsquo;s glance, and set it wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the threshold stepped a tall figure under a wide, featherless hat,
      and wrapped in a cloak which he loosened as he entered, revealing the very
      plainest of raiment beneath. A leather hacketon was tightened at the waist
      by a girdle of hammered steel, from which depended on his left a long
      sword with ringed, steel quillons, whilst from behind his right hip peeped
      the hilt of a stout Pistoja dagger. His hose of red cloth vanished into
      boots of untanned leather, laced in front and turned down at the knees,
      and completed in him the general appearance of a mercenary in time of
      peace, in spite of which the six nobles, in that place of paradoxes, bared
      their heads anew, and stood in attitudes of deferential attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment to throw off his cloak, of which the young man who had
      admitted him hastened to relieve him as readily as if he had been born a
      servitor. He next removed his hat, and allowed it to remain slung from his
      shoulders, displaying, together with a still youthful countenance of
      surpassing strength and nobility, a mane of jet-black hair coiffed in a
      broad net of gold thread&mdash;the only article of apparel that might have
      suggested his station to be higher than at first had seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped briskly to the coarse and grease-stained table, about which the
      company was standing, and his black eyes ran swiftly over the faces that
      confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I am here. My horse went lame a half-league
      beyond Sant&rsquo; Angelo, and I was constrained to end the journey on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency will be tired,&rdquo; cried Fabrizio, with that ready
      solicitude which is ever at the orders of the great. &ldquo;A cup of Puglia
      wine, my lord. Here, Fanfulla,&rdquo; he called, to the young nobleman who had
      acted as usher. But the new-comer silenced him and put the matter aside
      with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that wait. Time imports as you little dream. It may well be,
      illustrious sirs, that had I not come thus I had not come at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried one, expressing the wonder that rose in every mind, even as
      on every countenance some consternation showed. &ldquo;Are we betrayed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are in case to fear betrayal, it may well be, my friends. As I
      crossed the bridge over the Metauro and took the path that leads hither,
      my eyes were caught by a crimson light shining from a tangle of bushes by
      the roadside. That crimson flame was a reflection of the setting sun
      flashed from the steel cap of a hidden watcher. The path took me nearer,
      and with my hat so set that it might best conceal my face, I was all eyes.
      And as I passed the spot where that spy was ambushed, I discerned among
      the leaves that might so well have screened him, but that the sun had
      found his helmet out, the evil face of Masuccio Torri.&rdquo; There was a stir
      among the listeners, and their consternation increased, whilst one or two
      changed colour. &ldquo;For whom did he wait? That was the question that I asked
      myself, and I found the answer that it was for me. If I was right, he must
      also know the distance I had come, so that he would not look to see me
      afoot, nor yet, perhaps, in garments such as these. And so, thanks to all
      this and to the hat and cloak in which I closely masked myself, he let me
      pass unchallenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed Fabrizio hotly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear your conclusions
      were wrong. In all Italy it was known to no man beyond us six that you
      were to meet us here, and with my hand upon the Gospels I could swear that
      not one of us has breathed of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round at his companions as if inviting them to bear out his
      words, and they were not slow to confirm what he had sworn, in terms as
      vehement as his own, until in the end the new-comer waved them into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor have I breathed it,&rdquo; he assured them, &ldquo;for I respected your
      injunction, Messer Fabrizio. Still&mdash;what did Masuccio there, hidden
      like a thief, by the roadside? Sirs,&rdquo; he continued, in a slightly altered
      tone, &ldquo;I know not to what end you have bidden me hither, but if aught of
      treason lurks in your designs, I cry you beware! The Duke has knowledge of
      it, or at least, suspicion. If that spy was not set to watch for me, why,
      then, he was set to watch for all, that he may anon inform his master what
      men were present at this meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabrizio shrugged his shoulders in a contemptuous indifference which was
      voiced by his neighbour Ferrabraccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be informed,&rdquo; sneered the latter, a grim smile upon his rugged
      face. &ldquo;The knowledge will come to him too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer threw back his head, and a look that was half wonder, half
      enlightenment gleamed in the black depths of his imperious eyes. He took a
      deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem, sirs, that I was right,&rdquo; said he, with a touch of
      sternness, &ldquo;and that treason is indeed your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord of Aquila,&rdquo; Fabrizio answered him, &ldquo;we are traitors to a man that
      we may remain faithful and loyal to a State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What State?&rdquo; barked the Lord of Aquila contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchy of Babbiano,&rdquo; came the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be false to the Duke that you may be faithful to the Duchy?&rdquo; he
      questioned, scorn running ever stronger in his voice. &ldquo;Sirs, it is a
      riddle I&rsquo;ll not pretend to solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There fell a pause in which they eyed one another, and their glances were
      almost as the glances of baffled men. They had not looked for such a tone
      from him, and they questioned with their eyes and minds the wisdom of
      going further. At last, with a half-sigh, Fabrizio da Lodi turned once
      more to Aquila.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Count,&rdquo; he began, in a calm, impressive voice, &ldquo;I am an old man; the
      name I bear and the family from which I spring are honourable alike. You
      cannot think so vilely of me as to opine that in my old age I should do
      aught to smirch the fair fame of the one or of the other. To be named a
      traitor, sir, is to be given a harsh title, and one, I think, that could
      fit no man less than it fits me or any of these my companions. Will you do
      me the honour, then, to hear me out, Excellency; and when you have heard
      me, judge us. Nay, more than judgment we ask of you, Lord Count. We ask
      for guidance that we may save our country from the ruin that threatens it,
      and we promise you that we will take no step that has not your sanction&mdash;that
      is not urged by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco del Falco, Count of Aquila, eyed the old noble with a glance
      that had changed whilst he spoke, so that from scornful that it had been,
      it had now grown full of mild wonder and inquiry. He slightly inclined his
      head in token of acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg that you will speak,&rdquo; was all he said, and Fabrizio would forthwith
      have spoken but that Ferrabraccio intervened to demand that Aquila should
      pass them his knightly word not to betray them in the event of his
      rejection of the proposals they had to make. When he had given them his
      promise, and they had seated themselves upon such rude stools as the place
      afforded, Fabrizio resumed his office of spokesman, and unfolded the
      business upon which he had invited the Count among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a brief preamble he touched upon the character of Gian Maria Sforza,
      the reigning Duke of Babbiano&mdash;seated upon its throne by his powerful
      uncle, Lodovico Sforza, Lord of Milan. He exposed the man&rsquo;s reckless
      extravagances, his continued self-indulgence, his carelessness in matters
      of statecraft, and his apparent disinclination to fulfil the duties which
      his high station imposed upon him. On all this Fabrizio touched with most
      commendable discretion and restraint, as was demanded by the circumstance
      that in Francesco del Falco he was addressing the Duke&rsquo;s own cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far, Excellency,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you cannot be in ignorance of the
      general dissatisfaction prevailing among our most illustrious cousin&rsquo;s
      subjects. There was the conspiracy of Bacolino, a year ago, which, had it
      succeeded, would have cast us into the hands of Florence. It failed, but
      another such might not fail again. The increased disfavour of his Highness
      may bring more adherents to a fresh conspiracy of this character, and we
      should be lost as an independent state. And the peril that menaces us is
      the peril of being so lost. Not only by defection of our own, but by the
      force of arms of another. That other is Caesar Borgia. His dominion is
      spreading like a plague upon the face of this Italy, which he has
      threatened to eat up like an artichoke&mdash;leaf by leaf. Already his
      greedy eyes are turned upon us, and what power have we&mdash;all unready
      as we are&mdash;wherewith successfully to oppose the overwhelming might of
      the Duke of Valentinois? All this his Highness realises, for we have made
      it more than clear to him, as we have, too, made clear the remedy. Yet
      does he seem as indifferent to his danger as to his salvation. His time is
      spent in orgies, in dancing, in hawking and in shameful dalliance, and if
      we dare throw out a word of warning, threats and curses are the only
      answer we receive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Da Lodi paused, as if growing conscious that his manner was becoming
      over-vehement. But of this, his companions, at least, were all
      unconscious, for they filled the pause with a murmur of angry
      confirmation. Francesco wrinkled his brow, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;alas!&mdash;most fully conscious of this danger you speak of.
      But&mdash;what do you expect of me? Why bear me your grievance? I am no
      statesman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is no statesman needed, lord. It is a soldier Babbiano requires; a
      martial spirit to organise an army against the invasion that must come&mdash;that
      is coming already. In short, Lord Count, we need such a warrior as are
      you. What man is there in all Italy&mdash;or, indeed, what woman or what
      child&mdash;that has not heard of the prowess of the Lord of Aquila? Your
      knightly deeds in the wars &lsquo;twixt Pisa and Florence, your feats of arms
      and generalship in the service of the Venetians, are matters for the
      making of epic song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Fabrizio!&rdquo; murmured Paolo, seeking to restrain his eulogistic
      interlocutor, what time a faint tinge crept into his bronzed cheeks. But
      Da Lodi continued, all unheeding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall you, my lord, who have borne yourself so valiantly as a
      condottiero in the service of the stranger, hesitate to employ your skill
      and valour against the enemies of your own homeland? Not so, Excellency.
      We know the patriotic soul of Francesco del Falco, and we count upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do well,&rdquo; he answered firmly. &ldquo;When the time comes you shall find
      me ready. But until then, and touching such preparation as must be made&mdash;why
      do you not address his Highness as you do me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sad smile crossed the noble face of Lodi, whilst Ferrabraccio laughed
      outright in chill contempt, and with characteristic roughness made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we speak to him,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;of knightly deeds, of prowess, and of
      valour? I would as lief enjoin Roderigo Borgia to fulfil the sacred duties
      of his Vicarship; I might as profitably sprinkle incense on a dunghill.
      What we could say to Gian Maria we have said, and since it had been idle
      to have appealed to him as we have appealed to you, we have shown him yet
      another way by which Babbiano might be saved and Valentino&rsquo;s onslaught
      averted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And this other way?&rdquo; inquired the Count, his glance wandering back to
      Fabrizio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An alliance with the house of Urbino,&rdquo; answered Lodi. &ldquo;Guidobaldo has two
      nieces. We have sounded him, and we have found him well disposed towards
      such a marriage as we suggested. Allied thus to the house of Montefeltro,
      we should receive not only assistance from Guidobaldo, but also from the
      lords of Bologna, Perugia, Camerino, and some smaller states whose
      fortunes are linked already to that of Urbino. Thus we should present to
      Cesar Borgia a coalition so strong that he would never dare to bring a
      lance into our territory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard some talk of it,&rdquo; said Paolo. &ldquo;It would have been a wise step
      indeed. Pity that the negotiations came to naught!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did they come to naught? Body of Satan!&mdash;why?&rdquo; roared the
      impetuous Ferrabraccio, as with his mighty fist he smote the table a blow
      that well-nigh shattered it. &ldquo;Because Gian Maria was not in a marrying
      mood! The girl we proposed to him was beautiful as an angel; but he would
      not so much as look. There was a woman in Babbiano who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; cut in Fabrizio hastily, fearing the lengths to which the other
      might go, &ldquo;it is as Ferrabraccio says. His Highness would not marry. And
      this it is has led us to invite you to meet us here to-night. His Highness
      will do nothing to save the Duchy, and so we turn to you. The people are
      with us; in every street of Babbiano are you spoken of openly as the duke
      they would have govern them and defend their homes. In the sacred name of
      the people, then,&rdquo; the old man concluded, rising, and speaking in a voice
      shaken by emotion, &ldquo;and with the people&rsquo;s voice, of which we are but the
      mouthpiece, we now offer you the crown of Babbiano. Return with us
      to-night, my lord, and to-morrow, with but twenty spears for escort, we
      shall ride into Babbiano and proclaim you Duke. Nor need you fear the
      slightest opposition. One man only of Babbiano&mdash;that same Masuccio
      whom you tell us that you saw to-night&mdash;remains faithful to Gian
      Maria; faithful because he and the fifty Swiss mercenaries at his heels
      are paid to be so. Up, my lord! Let your own good sense tell you whether
      an honest man need scruple to depose a prince whose throne knows no
      defence beyond the hired protection of fifty foreign spears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed that impassioned speech. Lodi remained standing, the
      others sat, their eager glances turned upon the Count, their ears
      anxiously alert for his reply. Thus they remained for a brief spell,
      Aquila himself so still that he scarcely seemed to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat, gripping the arms of his chair, his head fallen forward until his
      chin rested on his breast, a frown darkening his lofty brow. And whilst
      they waited for his answer, a mighty battle was fought out within his
      soul. The power so suddenly, so unexpectedly, thrust within his reach, and
      offered him if he would but open his hands to grasp it, dazzled him for
      one little moment. As in a flash he saw himself Lord of Babbiano. He
      beheld a proud career of knightly deeds that should cause his name and
      that of Babbiano to ring throughout the length and breadth of Italy. From
      the obscure state that it was, his patriotism and his skill as a
      condottiero should render it one of the great Italian powers&mdash;the
      rival of Florence, of Venice or Milan. He had a vision of widened
      territories, and of neighbouring lords becoming vassals to his might. He
      saw himself wresting Romagna mile by mile from the sway of the ribald
      Borgia, hunting him to the death as he was wont to hunt the boar in the
      marshes of Commachio, or driving him into the very Vatican to seek shelter
      within his father&rsquo;s gates&mdash;the last strip of soil that he would leave
      him to lord it over. He dreamt of a Babbiano courted by the great
      republics, and the honour of its alliance craved by them that they might
      withstand the onslaughts of French and Spaniard. All this he saw in that
      fleeting vision of his, and Temptation caught his martial spirit in a grip
      of steel. And then another picture rose before his eyes. What would he do
      in times of peace? His was a soul that pined in palaces. He was born to
      the camp, and not to the vapid air of courts. In exchange for this power
      that was offered him what must he give? His glorious liberty. Become their
      lord in many things, to be their slave in more. Nominally to rule, but
      actually to be ruled, until, should he fail to do his rulers&rsquo; will, there
      would be some night another meeting such as this, in which men would plot
      to encompass his downfall and to supplant him as he was invited to
      supplant Gian Maria. Lastly, he bethought him of the man whose power he
      was bidden to usurp. His own cousin, his father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son, in whose
      veins ran the same blood as in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head at last, and met those anxious faces on which the
      fitful light was casting harsh shadows. The pale ghost of a smile hovered
      for a second on the corners of his stern mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sirs, for the honour you have done me,&rdquo; he made answer
      slowly, &ldquo;an honour of which I fear I am all unworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In strenuous chorus their voices rose to contradict him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, then, an honour which I cannot accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and their faces from eager that they had
      been, grew downcast to the point of sullenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, my lord?&rdquo; cried old Fabrizio at last, his arms outstretched
      towards the Count, his voice quivering with intensity. &ldquo;Santissima
      Vergine! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;to give you but one reason out of many&mdash;the man you
      ask me to overthrow and supplant is of my own blood.&rdquo; And but that his
      tone was calm they might have held that he rebuked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought,&rdquo; hazarded seriously the gay Fanfulla, &ldquo;that with such a
      man as your Excellency, patriotism and the love of Babbiano would have
      weighed even more than the ties of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had thought well, Fanfulla. Did I not say that the reason I gave
      you was but one of many? Tell me, sirs, what cause have you to believe
      that I should rule you wisely and well? It so chances that in the crisis
      now threatening Babbiano a captain is needed for its ruler. But let not
      this delude you, for there may come a season in the fortunes of the State
      when such a man might be as unfitted for dominion as is the present Duke
      in this. What then? A good knight-errant is an indifferent courtier and a
      bad statesman. Lastly, my friends&mdash;since you must know all that is in
      my heart&mdash;there remains the fact that I love myself a little. I love
      my liberty too well, and I have no mind to stifle in the scented
      atmosphere of courts. You see I am frank with you. It is my pleasure to
      roam the world, my harness on my back, free as the blessed wind of heaven.
      Shall a ducal crown and a cloak of purple&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
      sharply with a laugh. &ldquo;There, my friends! You have had reasons and to
      spare. Again I thank you, and deplore that being such as I am, I may not
      become such as you would have me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank back in his chair, eyeing them with a glance never so wistful, and
      after a second&rsquo;s silence, Da Lodi&rsquo;s voice implored him, in accents that
      trembled with pathetic emphasis, to reconsider his resolve. The old man
      would have proceeded to fresh argument, but Aquila cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already so well considered it, Messer Fabrizio,&rdquo; he answered
      resolutely, &ldquo;that nothing now could sway me. But this, sirs, I will
      promise you: I will ride with you to Babbiano, and I will seek to reason
      with my cousin. More will I do; I will seek at his hands the office of
      Gonfalonier, and if he grant it me; I will so reorganise our forces, and
      enter into such alliances with our neighbours as shall ensure, at least in
      some degree, the safety of our State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still they endeavoured to cajole him, but he held firm against their
      efforts, until in the end, with a sorrowful mien, Da Lodi thanked him for
      his promise to use his influence with Gian Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this, at least, we thank your Excellency, and on our part we shall
      exert such power as we still wield in Babbiano to the end that the high
      office of Gonfalonier be conferred upon you. We had preferred to see you
      fill with honour a position higher still, and should you later come to
      consider&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dismiss your hopes of that,&rdquo; put in the Count, with a solemn shake of his
      head. And then, before another word was uttered, young Fanfulla degli
      Arcipreti leapt of a sudden to his feet, his brows knit, and an expression
      of alarm spreading upon his comely face. A second he remained thus; then,
      going swiftly to the door, he opened it, and stood listening, followed by
      the surprised glances of the assembled company. But it needed not the
      warning cry with which he turned, to afford them the explanation of his
      odd behaviour. In the moment&rsquo;s tense silence that had followed his sudden
      opening of the door they had caught from without the distant fall of
      marching feet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. ON A MOUNTAIN PATH
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armed men, my lords!&rdquo; had been Fanfulla&rsquo;s cry. &ldquo;We are betrayed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another with stern eyes, and with that grimness that
      takes the place which fear would hold in meaner souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Aquila rose slowly to his feet, and with him rose the others, looking
      to their weapons. He softly breathed a name&mdash;&ldquo;Masuccio Torri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; cried Lodi bitterly, &ldquo;would that we had heeded your warning!
      Masuccio it will be, and at his heels his fifty mercenaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not less, I&rsquo;ll swear, by the sound of them,&rdquo; said Ferrabraccio. &ldquo;And we
      but six, without our harness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; the Count laconically amended, resuming his hat and loosening his
      sword in its scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, my lord,&rdquo; exclaimed Lodi, laying a hand upon the Count&rsquo;s arm.
      &ldquo;You must not stay with us. You are our only hope&mdash;the only hope of
      Babbiano. If we are indeed betrayed&mdash;though by what infernal means I
      know not&mdash;and they have knowledge that six traitors met here to-night
      to conspire against the throne of Gian Maria, at least, I&rsquo;ll swear, it is
      not known that you were to have met us. His Highness may conjecture, but
      he cannot know for sure, and if you but escape, all may yet he well&mdash;saving
      with us, who matter not. Go, my lord! Remember your promise to seek at
      your cousin&rsquo;s hand the gonfalon, and may God and His blessed Saints
      prosper your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man caught the young man&rsquo;s hand, and bending his head until his
      face was hidden in his long white hair, he imprinted a kiss of fealty upon
      it. But Aquila was not so easily to be dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your horses?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tethered at the back. But who would dare ride them at night adown this
      precipice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare for one,&rdquo; answered the young man steadily, &ldquo;and so shall you all
      dare. A broken neck is the worst that can befall us, and I would as lief
      break mine on the rocks of Sant&rsquo; Angelo as have it broken by the
      executioner of Babbiano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravely said, by the Virgin!&rdquo; roared Ferrabraccio. &ldquo;To horse, sirs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the only way is the way by which they come,&rdquo; Fanfulla remonstrated.
      &ldquo;The rest is sheer cliff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, my sweet seducer, we&rsquo;ll go to meet them,&rdquo; rejoined
      Ferrabraccio gaily. &ldquo;They are on foot, and we&rsquo;ll sweep over them like a
      mountain torrent. Come, sirs, hasten! They draw nigh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have but six horses, and we are seven,&rdquo; another objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no horse,&rdquo; said Francesco, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you afoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Ferrabraccio, who seemed now to have assumed command of the
      enterprise. &ldquo;Let our St. Michael bring up the rear! No, no. You, Da Lodi,
      you are too old for this work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too old?&rdquo; blazed the old man, drawing himself up to the full height of
      what was still a very imposing figure, and his eyes seeming to take fire
      at this reflection upon his knightly worth. &ldquo;Were the season other,
      Ferrabraccio, I could crave leave to show you how much of youth there is
      still left in me. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused. His angry eyes had
      alighted upon the Count, who stood waiting by the door, and the whole
      expression of his countenance changed. &ldquo;You are right, Ferrabraccio, I
      grow old indeed&mdash;a dotard. Take you my horse, and begone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you?&rdquo; quoth the Count solicitously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall remain. If you do your duty well by those hirelings they will not
      trouble me. It will not occur to them that one was left behind. They will
      think only of following you after you have cut through them. Go, go, sirs,
      or all is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed him now with a rush that seemed almost to partake of panic. In
      a frenzied haste Fanfulla and another tore the tetherings loose, and a
      moment later they were all mounted and ready for that fearful ride. The
      night was dark, yet not too dark. The sky was cloudless and thickly
      starred, whilst a minguant moon helped to illumine the way by which they
      were to go. But on that broken and uncertain mountain path the shadows lay
      thickly enough to make their venture desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrabraccio claiming a better knowledge than his comrades of the way,
      placed himself at their head, with the Count beside him. Behind them, two
      by two, came the four others. They stood on a small ledge in the shadow of
      the great cliff that loomed on their left. Thence the mountain-side might
      be scanned&mdash;as well as in such a light it was to be discerned. The
      tramp of feet had now grown louder and nearer, and with it came the clank
      of armour. In front of them lay the path which sloped, for a hundred yards
      or more, to the first corner. Below them, on the right, the path again
      appeared at the point where it jutted out for some half-dozen yards in its
      zigzag course, and there Fanfulla caught the gleam of steel, reflecting
      the feeble moonlight. He drew Ferrabraccio&rsquo;s attention to it, and that
      stout warrior at once gave the word to start. But Francesco interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we do so,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;we shall come upon them past the corner, and
      at that corner we shall be forced to slacken speed to avoid being carried
      over the edge of the cliff. Besides, in such a strait our horses may fail
      us, and refuse the ground. In any event, we shall not descend upon them
      with the same force as we shall carry if we wait until they come into a
      straight line with us. The shadows here will screen us from them
      meanwhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Lord Count. We will wait,&rdquo; was the ready answer. And what
      time they waited he grumbled lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be caught in such a trap as this! Body of Satan! It was a madness to
      have met in a hut with but one approach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might perhaps have retreated down the cliff behind,&rdquo; said Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might indeed&mdash;had we been sparrows or mountain cats. But being
      men, the way we go is the only way&mdash;and a mighty bad way it is. I
      should like to be buried at Sant&rsquo; Angelo, Lord Count,&rdquo; he continued
      whimsically. &ldquo;It will be conveniently near; for once I go over the
      mountain-side, I&rsquo;ll swear naught will stop me until I reach the valley&mdash;a
      parcel of broken bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, my friends,&rdquo; murmured the voice of Aquila. &ldquo;They come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And round that fateful corner they were now swinging into view&mdash;a
      company in steel heads and bodies with partisan on shoulder. A moment they
      halted now, so that the waiting party almost deemed itself observed. But
      it soon became clear that the halt was to the end that the stragglers
      might come up. Masuccio was a man who took no chances; every knave of his
      fifty would he have before he ventured the assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; murmured the Count, tightening his hat upon his brow, so that it
      might the better mask his features. Then rising in his stirrups, and
      raising his sword on high, he let his voice be heard again. But no longer
      in a whisper. Like a trumpet-call it rang, echoed and re-echoed up the
      mountain-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward! St. Michael and the Virgin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That mighty shout, followed as it was by a thunder of hooves, gave pause
      to the advancing mercenaries. Masuccio&rsquo;s voice was heard, calling to them
      to stand firm; bidding them kneel and ward the charge with their pikes;
      assuring them with curses that they had but to deal with half-dozen men.
      But the mountain echoes were delusive, and that thunder of descending
      hooves seemed to them not of a half-dozen but of a regiment. Despite
      Masuccio&rsquo;s imprecations the foremost turned, and in that moment the riders
      were upon them, through them and over them, like the mighty torrent of
      which Ferrabraccio had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen Swiss went down beneath that onslaught, and another dozen that had
      been swept aside and over the precipice were half-way to the valley before
      that cavalcade met any check. Masuccio&rsquo;s remaining men strove lustily to
      stem this human cataract, now that they realised how small was the number
      of their assailants. They got their partisans to work, and for a few
      moments the battle raged hot upon that narrow way. The air was charged
      with the grind and ring of steel, the stamping of men and horses and the
      shrieks and curses of the maimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord of Aquila, ever foremost, fought desperately on. Not only with
      his sword fought he, but with his horse as well. Rearing the beast on its
      hind legs, he would swing it round and let it descend where least it was
      expected, laying about him with his sword at the same time. In vain they
      sought to bring down his charger with their pikes; so swift and furious
      was his action, that before their design could be accomplished, he was
      upon those that meditated it, scattering them out of reach to save their
      skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this ferocious manner he cleared a way before him, and luck served him
      so well that what blows were wildly aimed at him as he dashed by went wide
      of striking him. At last he was all but through the press, and but three
      men now fronted him. Again his charger reared, snorting, and pawing the
      air like a cat, and two of the three knaves before him fled incontinently
      aside. But the third, who was of braver stuff, dropped on one knee and
      presented his pike at the horse&rsquo;s belly. Francesco made a wild attempt to
      save the roan that had served him so gallantly, but he was too late. It
      came down to impale itself upon that waiting partisan. With a hideous
      scream the horse sank upon its slayer, crushing him beneath its mighty
      weight, and hurling its rider forward on to the ground. In an instant he
      was up and had turned, for all that he was half-stunned by his fall and
      weakened by the loss of blood from a pike-thrust in the shoulder&mdash;of
      which he had hitherto remained unconscious in the heat of battle. Two
      mercenaries were bearing down upon him&mdash;the same two that had been
      the last to fall back before him. He braced himself to meet them, thinking
      that his last hour was indeed come, when Fanfulla degli Arcipreti, who had
      followed him closely through the press, now descended upon his assailants
      from behind, and rode them down. Beside the Count he reined up, and
      stretched down his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mount behind me, Excellency,&rdquo; he urged him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not time,&rdquo; answered Francesco, who discerned a half-dozen
      figures hurrying towards them. &ldquo;I will cling to your stirrup-leather,
      thus. Now spur!&rdquo; And without waiting for Fanfulla to obey him, he caught
      the horse a blow with the flat of his sword across the hams, which sent it
      bounding forward. Thus they continued now that perilous descent, Fanfulla
      riding, and the Count half-running, half-swinging from his stirrup. At
      last, when they had covered a half-mile in this fashion, and the going had
      grown easier, they halted that the Count might mount behind his companion,
      and as they now rode along at an easier pace Francesco realised that he
      and Fanfulla were the only two that had come through that ugly place. The
      gallant Ferrabraccio, hero of a hundred strenuous battles, had gone to the
      ignoble doom which half in jest he had prophesied himself. His horse had
      played him false at the outset of the charge, and taking fright it had
      veered aside despite his efforts to control it, until, losing its
      foothold, man and beast had gone hurtling over the cliff. Amerini,
      Fanfulla had seen slain, whilst the remaining two, being both unhorsed,
      would doubtless be the prisoners of Masuccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some three miles beyond Sant&rsquo; Angelo, Fanfulla&rsquo;s weary horse splashed
      across a ford of the Metauro, and thus, towards the second hour of night,
      they gained the territory of Urbino, where for the time they might hold
      themselves safe from all pursuit.

      The fool and the friar had fallen a-quarrelling, and&mdash;to the shame of
      the friar and the glory of the fool be it spoken&mdash;their subject of
      contention was a woman. Now the friar, finding himself no match for the
      fool in words, and being as broad and stout of girth and limb as the other
      was puny and misshapen, he had plucked off his sandal that with it he
      might drive the full force of his arguments through the jester&rsquo;s skull. At
      that the fool, being a very coward, had fled incontinently through the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running, like the fool he was, with his head turned to learn whether the
      good father followed him, he never saw the figure that lay half-hidden in
      the bracken, and might never have guessed its presence but that tripping
      over it he shot forward, with a tinkle of bells, on to his crooked nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up with a groan, which was answered by an oath from the man into
      whose sides he had dug his flying feet. The two looked at one another in
      surprise, tempered with anger in the one and dismay in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good awakening to you, noble sir,&rdquo; quoth the fool politely; for by the
      mien and inches of the man he had roused, he thought that courtesy might
      serve him best.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other eyed him with interest, as well he might; for an odder figure it
      would be hard to find in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunched of back, under-sized, and fragile of limb, he was arrayed in
      doublet, hose and hood, the half of which was black the other crimson,
      whilst on his shoulders fell from that same hood&mdash;which tightly
      framed his ugly little face&mdash;a foliated cape, from every point of
      which there hung a tiny silver bell that glimmered in the sunlight, and
      tinkled as he moved. From under bulging brows a pair of bright eyes, set
      wide as an owl&rsquo;s, took up the mischievous humour of his prodigious mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curse on you and him that sent you,&rdquo; was the answering greeting he
      received. Then the man checked his anger and broke into a laugh at sight
      of the fear that sprang into the jester&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave your pardon&mdash;most humbly do I crave it, Illustrious,&rdquo; said
      the fool, still in fear. &ldquo;I was pursued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pursued?&rdquo; echoed the other, in a tone not free from a sudden uneasiness.
      &ldquo;And, pray, by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the very fiend, disguised in the gross flesh and semblance of a
      Dominican brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you jest?&rdquo; came the angry question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest? Had you caught his villainous sandal between your shoulders, as did
      I, you would know how little I have a mind to jest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now answer me a plain question, if you have the wit to answer with,&rdquo;
       quoth the other, anger ever rising in his voice. &ldquo;Is there hereabouts a
      monk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, is there&mdash;may a foul plague rot him!&mdash;lurking in the
      bushes yonder. He is over-fat to run, or you had seen him at my heels,
      arrayed in that panoply of avenging wrath that is the cognisance of the
      Church Militant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go bring him hither,&rdquo; was the short answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gesù!&rdquo; gasped the fool, in very real affright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go near him till
      his anger cools&mdash;not if you made me straight and bribed me with the
      Patrimony of St. Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man turned from him impatiently, and rising his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanfulla!&rdquo; he called over his shoulder, and then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
      again: &ldquo;Olá, Fanfulla!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here, my lord,&rdquo; came an answering voice from behind a clump of
      bushes on their right, and almost immediately the very splendid youth who
      had gone to sleep in its shadow stood up and came round to them. At sight
      of the fool he paused to take stock of him, what time the fool returned
      the compliment with wonder-stricken interest. For however much Fanfulla&rsquo;s
      raiment might have suffered in yesternight&rsquo;s affray, it was very gorgeous
      still, and in the velvet cap upon his head a string of jewels was
      entwined. Yet not so much by the richness of his trappings was the fool
      impressed, as by the fact that one so manifestly noble should address by
      such a title, and in a tone of so much deference, this indifferently
      apparelled fellow over whom he had stumbled. Then his gaze wandered back
      to the man who lay supported on his elbow, and he noticed now the gold net
      in which his hair was coiffed, and which was by no means common to mean
      folk. His little twinkling eyes turned their attention full upon the face
      before him, and of a sudden a gleam of recognition entered them. His
      countenance underwent a change, and from grotesque that it had been, it
      became more grotesque still in its hasty assumption of reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord of Aquila!&rdquo; he murmured, scrambling to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he got erect when a hand gripped him by the shoulder, and
      Fanfulla&rsquo;s dagger flashed before his startled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear on the cross of this, never to divulge his Excellency&rsquo;s presence
      here, or take you the point of it in your foolish heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear, I swear!&rdquo; he cried, in fearful haste, his hand upon the hilt,
      which Fanfulla now held towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now fetch the priest, good fool,&rdquo; said the Count, with a smile at the
      hunchback&rsquo;s sudden terror. &ldquo;You have nothing to fear from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the jester had left them to go upon his errand, Francesco turned to
      his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanfulla, you are over-cautious,&rdquo; he said, with an easy smile. &ldquo;What
      shall it matter that I am recognised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have it happen for a kingdom while you are so near Sant&rsquo; 
      Angelo. The six of us who met last night are doomed&mdash;those of us who
      are not dead already. For me, and for Lodi if he was not taken, there may
      be safety in flight. Into the territory of Babbiano I shall never again
      set foot whilst Gian Maria is Duke, unless I be weary of this world. But
      of the seventh&mdash;yourself&mdash;you heard old Lodi swear that the
      secret could not have transpired. Yet should his Highness come to hear of
      your presence in these parts and in my company, suspicion might set him on
      the road that leads to knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then?&rdquo; returned the other, eyeing Francesco in surprise. &ldquo;Why, then, the
      hopes we found on you&mdash;the hopes of every man in Babbiano worthy of
      the name&mdash;would be frustrated. But here comes our friend the fool,
      and, in his wake, the friar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fra Domenico&mdash;so was he very fitly named, this follower of St.
      Dominic&mdash;approached with a solemnity that proceeded rather from his
      great girth than from any inflated sense of the dignity of his calling. He
      bowed before Fanfulla until his great crimson face was hidden, and he
      displayed instead a yellow, shaven crown. It was as if the sun had set,
      and the moon had risen in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you skilled in medicine?&rdquo; quoth Fanfulla shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some knowledge, Illustrious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then see to this gentleman&rsquo;s wounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Dio mio! You are wounded, then?&rdquo; he began, turning to the Count, and
      he would have added other questions as pregnant, but that Aquila, drawing
      aside his hacketon at the shoulder, answered him quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sir priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips pursed in solicitude, the friar would have gone upon his knees,
      but that Francesco, seeing with what labour the movement must be fraught,
      rose up at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so bad that I cannot stand,&rdquo; said he, submitting himself to the
      monk&rsquo;s examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter expressed the opinion that it was nowise dangerous, however
      much it might be irksome, whereupon the Count invited him to bind it up.
      To this Fra Domenico replied that he had neither unguents nor linen, but
      Fanfulla suggested that he might get these things from the convent of
      Acquasparta, hard by, and proffered to accompany him thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being determined, they departed, leaving the Count in the company of
      the jester. Francesco spread his cloak, and lay down again, whilst the
      fool, craving his permission to remain, disposed himself upon his haunches
      like a Turk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your master, fool?&rdquo; quoth the Count, in an idle spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a man who clothes and feeds me, noble sir, but Folly is my only
      master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what end does he do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I pretend to be a greater fool than he, so that by contrast with
      me he seems unto himself wise, which flatters his conceit. Again, perhaps,
      because I am so much uglier than he that, again by contrast, he may
      account himself a prodigy of beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd, is it not?&rdquo; the Count humoured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half so odd as that the Lord of Aquila should lie here, roughly clad,
      a wound in his shoulder, talking to a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco eyed him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give thanks to God that Fanfulla is not here to hear you, or they had
      been your last words for pretty though he be, Messer Fanfulla is a very
      monster of bloodthirstiness. With me it is different. I am a man of very
      gentle ways, as you may have heard, Messer Buffoon. But see that you
      forget at once my station and my name, or you may realise how little they
      need buffoons in the Court of Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, forgive. I shall obey you,&rdquo; answered the hunchback, with a
      stricken manner. And then through the glade came a voice&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s
      voice, wondrous sweet and rich&mdash;calling: &ldquo;Peppino! Peppino!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my mistress calling me,&rdquo; quoth the fool, leaping to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you own a mistress, though Folly be your only master,&rdquo; laughed
      the Count. &ldquo;It would pleasure me to behold the lady whose property you
      have the honour to be, Ser Peppino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may behold her if you but turn your head,&rdquo; Peppino whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idly, with a smile upon his lips that was almost scornful, the Lord of
      Aquila turned his eyes in the direction in which the fool was already
      walking. And on the instant his whole expression changed. The amused scorn
      was swept from his countenance, and in its place there sat now a look of
      wonder that was almost awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there, on the edge of the clearing, in which he lay, he beheld a
      woman. He had a vague impression of a slender, shapely height, a fleeting
      vision of a robe of white damask, a camorra of green velvet, and a
      choicely wrought girdle of gold. But it was the glory of her peerless face
      that caught and held his glance in such ecstatic awe; the miracle of her
      eyes, which, riveted on his, returned his glance with one of mild
      surprise. A child she almost seemed, despite her height and womanly
      proportions, so fresh and youthful was her countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raised on his elbow, he lay there for a spell, and gazed and gazed, his
      mind running on visions which godly men have had of saints from Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the spell was broken by Peppino&rsquo;s voice, addressing her, his back
      servilely bent. Francesco bethought him of the deference due to one so
      clearly noble, and leaping to his feet, his wound forgotten, he bowed
      profoundly. A second later he gasped for breath, reeled, and swooning,
      collapsed supine among the bracken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. MONNA VALENTINA
    </h2>
    <p>
      In after years the Lord of Aquila was wont to aver in all solemnity that
      it was the sight of her wondrous beauty set up such a disorder in his soul
      that it overcame his senses, and laid him swooning at her feet. That he,
      himself, believed it so, it is not ours to doubt, for all that we may be
      more prone to agree with the opinion afterwards expressed by Fanfulla and
      the friar&mdash;and deeply resented by the Count&mdash;that in leaping to
      his feet in over-violent haste his wound re-opened, and the pain of this,
      combining with the weak condition that resulted from his loss of blood,
      had caused his sudden faintness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this, Peppe?&rdquo; she asked the fool, and he, mindful of the oath he
      had sworn, answered her brazenly that he did not know, adding that it was&mdash;as
      she might see&mdash;-some poor wounded fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded?&rdquo; she echoed, and her glorious eyes grew very pitiful. &ldquo;And
      alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a gentleman here, tending him, Madonna; but he is gone with Fra
      Domenico to the Convent of Acquasparta to seek the necessaries to mend his
      shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor gentleman,&rdquo; she murmured, approaching the fallen figure. &ldquo;How came
      he by his hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Madonna, is more than I can tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we do nothing for him until his friends return?&rdquo; was her next
      question, bending over the Count as she spoke. &ldquo;Come, Peppino,&rdquo; she cried,
      &ldquo;lend me your aid. Get me water from the brook, yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fool looked about him for a vessel, and his eye falling upon the
      Count&rsquo;s capacious hat, he snatched it up, and went his errand. When he
      returned, the lady was kneeling with the unconscious man&rsquo;s head in her
      lap. Into the hatful of water that Peppe brought her she dipped a
      kerchief, and with this she bathed the brow on which his long black hair
      lay matted and disordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how he has bled, Peppe,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;His doublet is drenched, and he
      is bleeding still! Vergine Santa!&rdquo; she cried, beholding now the ugly wound
      that gaped in his shoulder, and turning pale at the sight. &ldquo;Assuredly he
      will die of it&mdash;and he so young, Peppino, and so comely to behold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco stirred, and a sigh fluttered through his pallid lips. Then he
      raised his heavy lids, and their glances met and held each other. And so,
      eyes that were brown and tender looked down into feverish languid eyes of
      black, what time her gentle hand held the moist cloth to his aching brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angel of beauty!&rdquo; he murmured dreamily, being but half-awake as yet to
      his position. Then, becoming conscious of her ministrations, &ldquo;Angel of
      goodness!&rdquo; he added, with yet deeper fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no answer for him, saving such answer&mdash;and in itself it was
      eloquent enough&mdash;as her blushes made, for she was fresh from a
      convent and all innocent of worldly ways and tricks of gallant speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suffer?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffer?&rdquo; quoth he, now waking more and more, and his voice sounding a
      note of scorn. &ldquo;Suffer? My head so pillowed and a saint from Heaven
      ministering to my ills? Nay, I am in no pain, Madonna, but in a joy more
      sweet than I have ever known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gesù! What a nimble tongue!&rdquo; gibed the fool from the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you there, too, Master Buffoon?&rdquo; quoth Francesco. &ldquo;And Fanfulla? Is
      he not here? Why, now I bethink me; he went to Acquasparta with the
      friar.&rdquo; He thrust his elbow under him for more support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not move,&rdquo; said she, thinking that he would essay to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not, lady, if I must,&rdquo; he answered solemnly. And then, with his
      eyes upon her face, he boldly asked her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; she answered readily, &ldquo;is Valentina della Rovere, and I am
      niece to Guidobaldo of Urbino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His brows shot up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I indeed live,&rdquo; he questioned, &ldquo;or do I but dream the memories of some
      old romancer&rsquo;s tale, in which a wandering knight is tended thus by a
      princess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a knight?&rdquo; she asked, a wonder coming now into her eyes, for even
      into the seclusion of her convent-life had crept strange stories of these
      mighty men-at-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your knight at least, sweet lady,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;and ever your poor
      champion if you will do me so much honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A crimson flush stole now into her cheeks, summoned by his bold words and
      bolder glances, and her eyes fell. Yet, resentment had no part in her
      confusion. She found no presumption in his speech, nor aught that a brave
      knight might not say to the lady who had succoured him in his distress.
      Peppe, who stood listening and marking the Count&rsquo;s manner, knowing the
      knight&rsquo;s station, was filled now with wonder, now with mockery; yet never
      interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, sir knight?&rdquo; she asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes looked troubled, and as they shot beyond her to the fool, they
      caught on Peppe&rsquo;s face a grin of sly amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;is Francesco.&rdquo; And then, to prevent that she
      should further question him&mdash;&ldquo;But tell me, Madonna,&rdquo; he inquired,
      &ldquo;how comes a lady of your station here, alone with that poor fraction of a
      man?&rdquo; And he indicated the grinning Peppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My people are yonder in the woods, where we have halted for a little
      space. I am on my way to my uncle&rsquo;s court, from the Convent of Santa
      Sofia, and for my escort I have Messer Romeo Gonzaga and twenty spears. So
      that, you see, I am well protected, without counting Ser Peppe here and
      the saintly Fra Domenico, my confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, ended at length by Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be the younger niece of his Highness of Urbino?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, Messer Francesco,&rdquo; she answered readily. &ldquo;I am the elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that his brows grew of a sudden dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you be she whom they would wed to Gian Maria?&rdquo; he exclaimed, at which
      the fool pricked up his ears, whilst she looked at the Count with a gaze
      that plainly showed how far she was from understanding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing,&rdquo; he answered, with a sigh, and in that moment a man&rsquo;s voice
      came ringing through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna! Madonna Valentina!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco and the lady turned their eyes in the direction whence the voice
      proceeded, and they beheld a superbly dazzling figure entering the glade.
      In beauty of person and richness of apparel he was well worthy of the
      company of Valentina. His doublet was of grey velvet, set off with scales
      of beaten gold, and revealing a gold-embroidered vest beneath; his bonnet
      matched his doublet, and was decked by a feather that sparkled with costly
      gems; his gold-hilted sword was sheathed in a scabbard also of grey velvet
      set with jewels. His face was comely as a damsel&rsquo;s, his eyes blue and his
      hair golden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; announced Peppino gravely, &ldquo;Italy&rsquo;s latest translation of the
      Golden Ass of Apuleius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon seeing the noble niece of Guidobaldo kneeling there with Francesco&rsquo;s
      head still pillowed in her lap, the new-comer cast up his arms in a
      gesture of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints in Heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed, hurrying towards them. &ldquo;What occupation
      have you found? Who is this ugly fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugly?&rdquo; was all she answered him, in accents of profound surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; the young man insisted, his tone growing heated. &ldquo;And what
      does he here and thus, with you? Gesù! What would his Highness say? How
      would he deal with me were he to learn of this? Who is the man, Madonna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as you see, Messer Gonzaga,&rdquo; she answered, with some heat, &ldquo;a
      wounded knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A knight he?&rdquo; gibed Gonzaga. &ldquo;A thief more likely, a prowling masnadiero.
      What is your name?&rdquo; he roughly asked the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing himself a little away from Valentina, and reclining entirely upon
      his elbow, Francesco motioned him with a wave of the hand to come no
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg, lady, that you will bid your pretty page stand back a little. I am
      still faint, and his perfumes overpower me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under the mask of the polite request Gonzaga detected the mocking,
      contemptuous note, and it gave fuel to his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no page, fool,&rdquo; he answered, then clapping his hands together, he
      raised his voice to shout&mdash;&ldquo;Olá, Beltrame! To me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; cried the lady, rising to confront him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry this ruffian in bonds to Urbino, as is my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you may wound your pretty hands in grasping me,&rdquo; replied the Count,
      in chill indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You would threaten me with violence, vassal?&rdquo; cried the other,
      retreating some paces farther as he spoke. &ldquo;Beltrame!&rdquo; he called again.
      &ldquo;Are you never coming?&rdquo; A voice answered him from the thicket, and with a
      clank of steel a half-dozen men flung themselves into the glade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your orders, sir?&rdquo; craved he that led them, his eyes wandering to the
      still prostrate Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie me up this dog,&rdquo; Gonzaga bade him. But before the fellow could move a
      foot to carry out the order Valentina barred his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not,&rdquo; she commanded, and so transformed was she from the
      ingenuous child that lately had talked with him, that Francesco gaped in
      pure astonishment. &ldquo;In my uncle&rsquo;s name, I bid you leave this gentleman
      where he lies. He is a wounded knight whom I have been pleased to tend&mdash;a
      matter which seems to have aroused Messer Gonzaga&rsquo;s anger against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beltrame paused, and looked from Valentina to Gonzaga, undecided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; said Gonzaga, with assumed humility, &ldquo;your word is law with us.
      But I would have you consider that, what I bid Beltrame do is in the
      interest of his Highness, whose territory is infested by these vagabonding
      robbers. It is a fact that may not have reached you in your convent
      retreat, no more than has sufficient knowledge reached you yet&mdash;in
      your incomparable innocence&mdash;to distinguish between rogues and honest
      men. Beltrame, do my bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentina&rsquo;s foot tapped the ground impatiently, and into her eyes there
      came a look of anger that heightened her likeness to her martial uncle.
      But Peppe it was who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that there seem to be fools enough, already, meddling in this
      business,&rdquo; he said, in tones of mock lament, &ldquo;permit that I join their
      number, Ser Romeo, and listen to my counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out, fool,&rdquo; cried Gonzaga, cutting at him with his riding-switch, &ldquo;we
      need not your capers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you need my wisdom,&rdquo; retorted Ser Peppe, as he leapt beyond
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s reach. &ldquo;Hear me, Beltrame! For all that we do not doubt Messer
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s keen discrimination in judging &lsquo;twixt a rogue and an honest man,
      I do promise you, as surely as though I were Fate herself, that if you
      obey him now and tie up that gentleman, you will yourself be tied up for
      it, later on, in a yet uglier fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beltrame looked alarmed, Gonzaga incredulous. Valentina thanked Peppe with
      her eyes, thinking that he had but hit upon a subterfuge to serve her
      wishes, whilst Francesco, who had now risen to his feet, looked on with an
      amused smile as though the matter concerned him nowise personally. And
      then, in the very crux of the situation, Fanfulla and Fra Domenico
      appeared upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, well-returned, Fanfulla!&rdquo; the Count called to him, &ldquo;This pretty
      gentleman would have had me bound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you bound?&rdquo; echoed Fanfulla, in angry horror. &ldquo;Upon what grounds,
      pray?&rdquo; he demanded, turning fiercely upon Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impressed by Fanfulla&rsquo;s lordly air, Romeo Gonzaga grew amazingly humble
      for one that but a moment back had been so overbearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem, sir, that my judgment was at fault in esteeming his
      condition,&rdquo; he excused himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your judgment?&rdquo; returned the hot Fanfulla. &ldquo;And who bade you judge? Go
      cut your milk-teeth, boy, and meddle not with men if you would live to be
      a man yourself some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentina smiled, Peppe laughed outright, whilst even Beltrame and his
      followers grinned, all of which added not a little to Gonzaga&rsquo;s choler.
      But scant though his wisdom might be, it was yet enough to dictate
      prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The presence of Madonna here restrains me,&rdquo; he answered, with elaborate
      dignity. &ldquo;But should we meet again, I shall make bold to show you what
      manhood means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;if by then you shall have come to it.&rdquo; And with a shrug
      Fanfulla turned to give his attention to the Count, whom Fra Domenico was
      already tending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina, to relieve the awkwardness of the moment, proposed to Gonzaga
      that he should get his escort to horse, and have her litter in readiness,
      so that they might resume their journey as soon as Fra Domenico should
      have concluded his ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga bowed, and with a vicious glance at the strangers and an angry
      &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; to Beltrame and the others, he departed with the men-at-arms
      at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina remained with Fanfulla and Peppe, whilst Fra Domenico dressed
      Francesco&rsquo;s wound, and, presently, when the task was accomplished, they
      departed, leaving Fanfulla amid the Count alone. But ere she went she
      listened to Francesco&rsquo;s thanks, and suffered him to touch her ivory
      fingers with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much he might have said but that the presence of the other three
      restrained him. Yet some little of that much she may have seen reflected
      in his eyes, for all that day she rode pensive, a fond, wistful smile at
      the corners of her lips. And although to Gonzaga she manifested no
      resentment, yet did she twit him touching that mistake of his. Sore in his
      dignity, he liked her playful mockery little yet he liked the words in
      which she framed it less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you into so grievous an error, Ser Romeo?&rdquo; she asked him, more
      than once. &ldquo;How could you deem him a rogue&mdash;he with so noble a mien
      and so beautiful a countenance?&rdquo; And without heeding the sullenness of his
      answers, she would lapse with a sigh once more into reflection&mdash;a
      thing that galled Gonzaga more, perhaps, than did her gibes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. GIAN MARIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a week after the meeting &lsquo;twixt the niece of Guidobaldo and the
      Count of Aquila, when the latter&mdash;his wound being wellnigh healed&mdash;rode
      one morning under the great archway that was the main entrance to the city
      of Babbiano. The Captain of the Gate saluted him respectfully as he rode
      by, and permitted himself to marvel at the pallor of his Excellency&rsquo;s
      face. And yet, the cause was not very far to seek. It stood upon four
      spears, among a noisy flock of circling crows, above that very Gate&mdash;-called
      of San Bacolo&mdash;and consisted of four detruncated human heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of those dead faces grinning horribly, their long, matted hair
      fluttering like rags in the April breeze, had arrested Francesco&rsquo;s
      attention as he drew nigh. But when presently he came nearer and looked
      with more intentness, a shudder of recognition ran through him, and a
      great horror filled his soul and paled his cheek. The first of those heads
      was that of the valiant and well-named Ferrabraccio; the next that of
      Amerino Amerini; and the other two, those of his captured companions on
      that night at Sant&rsquo; Angelo.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it would seem that Gian Maria had been busy during the week that was
      sped, and that there, on the walls of Babbiano, lay rotting the only
      fruits which that ill-starred conspiracy was likely to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second it entered his mind to turn back. But his stout and fearless
      nature drove him on, all unattended as he was, and in despite of such
      vague forebodings as beset him. How much, he wondered, might Gian Maria
      know of his own share in that mountain meeting, and how would it fare with
      him if his cousin was aware that it had been proposed to the Count of
      Aquila to supplant him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not long, however, in learning that grounds were wanting for such
      fears as he had entertained. Gian Maria received him with even more than
      wonted welcome, for he laid much store by Francesco&rsquo;s judgment and was in
      sore need of it at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco found him at table, which had been laid for him amidst the
      treasures of art and learning that enriched the splendid Palace library.
      It was a place beloved by Gian Maria for the material comforts that it
      offered him, and so he turned it to a score of vulgar purposes of his own,
      yet never to that for which it was equipped, being an utter stranger to
      letters and ignorant as a ploughboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensconced in a great chair of crimson leather, at a board overladen with
      choice viands and sparkling with crystal flagons and with vessels and
      dishes of gold and enamel, Francesco found his cousin, and the air that
      had been heavy once with the scholarly smell of parchments and musty tomes
      was saturated now with pungent odours of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In stature Gian Maria was short and inclining, young though he was, to
      corpulency. His face was round and pale and flabby; his eyes blue and
      beady; his mouth sensual and cruel. He was dressed in a suit of lilac
      velvet, trimmed with lynx fur, and slashed, Spanish fashion, in the
      sleeves, to show the shirt of fine Rheims linen underneath. About his neck
      hung a gold chain, bearing an Agnus Dei, which contained a relic of the
      True Cross&mdash;for Gian Maria pushed his devoutness to great lengths.
    </p>
    <p>
      His welcome of Francesco was more effusive than its wont. He bade the two
      servants who attended him to lay a plate for his illustrious cousin, and
      when Aquila shortly yet courteously declined, with the assurance that he
      had dined already, the Duke insisted that, at least, he should drink a Cup
      of Malvasia. When out of a vessel of beaten gold they had filled a goblet
      for the Count, his Highness bade the servants go, and relaxed&mdash;if,
      indeed, so much may be said of one who never knew much dignity&mdash;before
      his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Aquila, when the first compliments were spent, &ldquo;strange
      stories of a conspiracy in your Duchy, and on the walls at the Gate of San
      Bacolo I beheld four heads, of men whom I have known and honoured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who dishonoured themselves ere their heads were made a banquet for
      the crows. There, Francesco!&rdquo; He shuddered, and crossed himself. &ldquo;It is
      unlucky to speak of the dead at table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us speak, then, of their offence alone,&rdquo; persisted Francesco subtly.
      &ldquo;In what did it lie?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what?&rdquo; returned the Duke amusedly. His voice was thin and inclining to
      shrillness. &ldquo;It is more than I can say. Masuccio knew. But the dog would
      not disclose his secret nor the names of the conspirators until his task
      should be accomplished and he had taken them at the treason he knew they
      had gathered to ripen. But,&rdquo; he continued, an olive poised &lsquo;twixt thumb
      and forefinger, &ldquo;it seems they were not to be captured as easily as he
      thought. He told me the traitors numbered six, and that they were to meet
      a seventh there. The men who returned from the venture tell me too, and
      without shame, that there were but some six or seven that beset them. Yet
      they gave the Swiss trouble enough, and killed some nine of them besides a
      half-score of more or less grievously wounded, whilst they but slew two of
      their assailants and captured another two. Those were the four heads you
      saw at the Porta San Bacolo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Masuccio?&rdquo; inquired Francesco. &ldquo;Has he not told you since who were
      those others that escaped?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Highness paused to masticate the olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there lies the difficulty,&rdquo; said he at length. &ldquo;The dog is dead. He
      was killed in the affray. May he rot in hell for his obstinate reticence.
      No, no!&rdquo; he checked himself hastily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, and the secret of this
      treason, as well as the names of the traitors, have perished with him. Yet
      I am a clement man, Francesco, and sorely though that dog has wronged me
      by his silence, I thank Heaven for the grace to say&mdash;God rest his
      vile soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count flung himself into a chair, as much to dissemble such signs of
      relief as might show upon his face, as because he wished to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely Masuccio left you some information!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very scantiest,&rdquo; returned Gian Maria, in chagrined accents. &ldquo;It was
      ever the way of that secretive vassal. Damn him! He frankly told me that
      if I knew, I would talk. Heard you ever of such insufferable insolence to
      a prince? All that he would let me learn was that there was a conspiracy
      afoot to supplant me, and that he was going to capture the conspirators,
      together with the man whom they were inviting to take my place. Ponder it,
      Francesco! Such are the murderous plans my loving subjects form for my
      undoing&mdash;I who rule them with a rod of gold, the most clement, just
      and generous prince in Italy. Cristo buono! Do you marvel that I lost
      patience and had their hideous heads set upon spears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did you not say that two of these conspirators were brought back
      captive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke nodded, his mouth too full for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, at their trial, what transpired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trial? There was no trial.&rdquo; Gian Maria chewed vigorously for a moment. &ldquo;I
      tell you I was so heated with anger at this base ingratitude, that I had
      not even the wit to have the names of their associates tortured out of
      them. Within a half-hour of their arrival in Babbiano, the heads of these
      men whom it had pleased Heaven to deliver up to me were where you saw them
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sent them thus to their death?&rdquo; gasped Francesco, rising to his feet
      and eyeing his cousin with mingled wonder and anger. &ldquo;You sent men of such
      families as these to the headsman, without a trial? I think, Gian Maria,
      that you must be mad if so rashly you can shed such blood as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke sank back in his chair to gape at his impetuous cousin. Then, in
      sullen anger: &ldquo;To whom do you speak?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a tyrant who calls himself the most clement, just and generous prince
      in Italy, and who lacks the wisdom to see that he is undermining with his
      own hands, and by his own rash actions, a throne that is already
      tottering. Can you not think that this might mean a revolution? It amounts
      to murder, and though dukes resort to it freely enough in Italy, it is not
      openly and defiantly wrought, as is this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anger there was in the Duke&rsquo;s soul, but there was still more fear&mdash;so
      much, that it shouldered the anger aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have provided against rebellion,&rdquo; he announced, with an ease that he
      vainly strove to feel. &ldquo;I have given the command of my guards to Martino
      Armstadt, and he has engaged for me a company of five hundred Swiss
      lanzknechte that were lately in the pay of the Baglioni of Perugia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you deem this security?&rdquo; rejoined Francesco, with a smile of scorn.
      &ldquo;To hedge your throne with foreign spears commanded by a foreigner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This and God&rsquo;s grace,&rdquo; was the pious answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; answered Francesco, impatient at the hypocrisy. &ldquo;Win the hearts of
      your people. Let that be your buckler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Gian Maria. &ldquo;You blaspheme. Does not every act of my
      self-sacrificing life point to such an aim? I live for my people. But, by
      my soul, they ask too much when they ask that I should die for them. If I
      serve those who plot against my life, as I have served these men you speak
      of, who shall blame me? I tell you, Francesco, I wish I might have those
      others who escaped, that I might do as much by them. By the living God, I
      do! And as for the man who was to have supplanted me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused, a deadly smile on his sensual mouth completing the sentence more
      effectively than lay within the power of words. &ldquo;Who could it have been?&rdquo;
       he mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve vowed that if Heaven will grant me that I discover him,
      I&rsquo;ll burn a candle to Santa Fosca every Saturday for a twelvemonth and go
      fasting on the Vigil of the Dead. Who&mdash;who could it have been,
      Franceschino?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; returned Francesco, evading the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know so much, Checco mio. Your mind is so quick to fathom matters of
      this kind. Think you, now, it might have been the Duca Valentino?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Caesar Borgia comes he will know no need to resort to such poor
      means. He will come in arms to reduce you by his might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God and the saints protect me!&rdquo; gasped the Duke. &ldquo;You talk of it as if he
      were already marching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I talk of it advisedly. The event is none so remote as you would
      make yourself believe. Listen, Gian Maria! I have not ridden from Aquila
      for just the pleasure of passing the time of day with you. Fabrizio da
      Lodi and Fanfulla degli Arcipreti have been with me of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you?&rdquo; cried the Duke, his little eyes narrowing themselves as they
      glanced up at his cousin. &ldquo;With you&mdash;­eh?&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders
      and spread his palms before him. &ldquo;Pish! See into what errors even so clear
      a mind as mine may fall. Do you know, Francesco, that marking their
      absence since that conspiracy was laid, I had a half-suspicion they were
      connected with it.&rdquo; And he devoted his attention to a honeycomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not in all your Duchy two hearts more faithful to Babbiano,&rdquo; was
      the equivocal reply. &ldquo;It was on the matter of this very peril that
      threatens you that they came to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Gian Maria&rsquo;s white face grew interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Count of Aquila talked to the Duke of Babbiano much as
      Fabrizio da Lodi had talked to the Count that night at Sant&rsquo; Angelo. He
      spoke of the danger that threatened from the Borgia, of the utter lack of
      preparation, and of Gian Maria&rsquo;s contempt of the counsels given him. He
      alluded to the discontent rife among his subjects at this state of things,
      and to the urgent need to set them right. When he had done, the Duke sat
      silent a while, his eyes bent thoughtfully upon his platter, on which the
      food lay now unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An easy thing, is it not, Francesco, to say to a man: this is wrong, and
      that is wrong. But who is there, pray, to set it right for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, if you will say but the word, I will attempt to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; cried the Duke, and far from manifesting satisfaction at having one
      offer himself to undertake to right this very crooked business, Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s face reflected an incredulous anger and some little scorn. &ldquo;And
      how, my marvellous cousin, would you set about it?&rdquo; he inquired, a sneer
      lurking in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would place such matters as the levying of money by taxation in the
      hands of Messer Despuglio, and at whatever sacrifice to your own
      extravagance, I would see that for months to come the bulk of these moneys
      is applied to the levying and arming of suitable men. I have some skill as
      a condottiero&mdash;leastways, so more than one foreign prince has been
      forced to acknowledge. I will lead your army when I have raised it, and I
      will enter into alliances for you with our neighbouring States, who,
      seeing us armed, will deem us a power worthy of their alliance. And so,
      what man can do to stem the impending flood of this invasion, that will I
      do to defend your Duchy. Make me your gonfalonier, and in a month I will
      tell you whether it lies in my power or not to save your State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of Gian Maria had narrowed more and more whilst Francesco spoke,
      and into his shallow face had crept an evil, suspicious look. As the Count
      ceased, he gave vent to a subdued laugh, bitter with mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make you my gonfalonier?&rdquo; he muttered, in consummate amusement. &ldquo;And
      since when has Babbiano been a republic&mdash;or is it your aim to make it
      one, and establish yourself as its chief magistrate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you misapprehend me so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Francesco, but his cousin
      interrupted him with heightening scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misapprehend you, Messer Franceschino? No, no. I understand you but too
      well.&rdquo; He rose suddenly from his interrupted meal, and came a step nearer
      his cousin. &ldquo;I hear rumours of this growing love my people are manifesting
      for the Count of Aquila, and I have let them go unheeded. That rogue
      Masuccio warned me ere he died, and I answered him with my whip across his
      face. But I am by no means sure that I have been proceeding wisely. I had
      a dream two nights ago&mdash;&mdash; But let that be! When it so happens
      that in any State there is a man whom the people prefer to him who rules
      them, and when it so happens that this man is of as good blood and high
      birth as are you, he becomes a danger to him that sits the throne. I need
      scarce remind you,&rdquo; he added, with a horrid grin, &ldquo;of how the Borgias deal
      with such individuals, nor need I add that a Sforza may see fit to emulate
      those very conclusive measures of precaution. The family of Sforza has
      bred as yet no fools, nor shall I prove myself the first by placing in
      another&rsquo;s hands the power to make himself my master. You see, my gentle
      cousin, how transparent your aims become under my eyes. I am keen of
      vision, Franceschino, keen of vision!&rdquo; He tapped his nose and chuckled a
      malicious appreciation of his own acute perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco regarded him with an eye of stony scorn. He might have answered,
      had he been so disposed, that the Duchy of Babbiano was his to take
      whenever he pleased. He might have told him that, and defied him. But he
      went more slowly than did this man of a family that bred no fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know me, then, so little, Gian Maria,&rdquo; said he, not without
      bitterness, &ldquo;that you think I hunger for so empty a thing as this ducal
      pomp you clutch so fearfully? I tell you, man, that I prefer my liberty to
      an imperial throne. But I waste breath with you. Yet, some day, when your
      crown shall have passed from you and your power have been engulfed in the
      Borgia&rsquo;s rapacious maw, remember my offer which might have saved you and
      which with insults you disregarded, as you disregarded the advice your
      older counsellors gave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria shrugged his fat shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If by that other advice you mean the counsel that I should take
      Guidobaldo&rsquo;s niece to wife, you may give ease unto your patriotic soul. I
      have consented to enter into this alliance. And now,&rdquo; he ended, with
      another of his infernal chuckles, &ldquo;you see how little I need dread this
      terrible son of Pope Alexander. Allied with Urbino and the other States
      that are its friends, I can defy the might of Caesar Borgia. I shall sleep
      tranquil of nights beside my beauteous bride, secure in the protection her
      uncle&rsquo;s armies will afford me, and never needing so much as my valiant
      cousin&rsquo;s aid as my gonfalonier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count of Aquila changed colour despite himself, and the Duke&rsquo;s
      suspicious eyes were as quick to observe it as was his mind to
      misinterpret its meaning. He registered a vow to set a watch on this
      solicitous cousin who offered so readily to bear his gonfalon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felicitate you, at least,&rdquo; said Francesco gravely, &ldquo;upon the wisdom of
      that step. Had I known of it I had not troubled you with other proposals
      for the safety of your State. But, may I ask you, Gian Maria, what
      influences led you to a course which, hitherto, you have so obstinately
      refused to follow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They plagued me so,&rdquo; he lamented, with a grimace, &ldquo;that in the end I
      consented. I could withstand Lodi and the others, but when my mother
      joined them with her prayers&mdash;I should say, her commands&mdash;and
      pointed out again my peril to me, I gave way. After all a man must wed.
      And since in my station he need not let his marriage weigh too much upon
      him, I resolved on it for the sake of security and peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since it was the salvation of Babbiano that he aimed at, the Count of
      Aquila should have rejoiced at Gian Maria&rsquo;s wise resolve, and no other
      consideration should have tempered so encompassing a thing as that joy of
      his should have been. Yet, when later he left his cousin&rsquo;s presence, the
      only feeling that he carried with him was a deep and bitter resentment
      against the Fate that willed such things, blent with a sorrowing pity for
      the girl that was to wed his cousin and a growing hatred for the cousin
      who made him pity her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. THE AMOROUS DUKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      From a window of the Palace of Babbiano the Lord of Aquila watched the
      amazing bustle in the courtyard below, and at his side stood Fanfulla
      degli Arcipreti, whom he had summoned from Perugia with assurances that,
      Masuccio being dead, no peril now menaced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a week after that interview at which Gian Maria had made known his
      intentions to his cousin, and his Highness was now upon the point of
      setting out for Urbino, to perform the comedy of wooing the Lady
      Valentina. This was the explanation of that scurrying of servitors and
      pages, that parading of men-at-arms, and that stamping of horses and mules
      in the quadrangle below. Francesco watched the scene with a smile of some
      bitterness, his companion with one of supreme satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praised be Heaven for having brought his Highness at last to a sense of
      his duty,&rdquo; remarked the courtier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has often happened to me,&rdquo; said Francesco, disregarding his
      companion&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;to malign the Fates for having brought me into the
      world a count. But in the future I shall give them thanks, for I see how
      much worse it might have been&mdash;I might have been born a prince, with
      a duchy to rule over. I might have been as that poor man, my cousin, a
      creature whose life is all pomp and no real dignity, all merry­making and
      no real mirth&mdash;loveless, isolated and vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the amazed Fanfulla, &ldquo;assuredly there are compensations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that bustle. You know what it portends. What compensation can
      there be for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a question you should be the last to ask, my lord. You have seen
      the niece of Guidobaldo, and having seen her, can you still ask what
      compensation does this marriage offer Gian Maria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, then, not understand?&rdquo; returned Aquila, with a wan smile. &ldquo;Do you
      not see the tragedy of it? Is it nothing that two States, having found
      that this marriage would be mutually advantageous, have determined that it
      shall take place? That meanwhile the chief actors&mdash;the victims, I
      might almost call them&mdash;have no opportunity of selecting for
      themselves. Gian Maria goes about it resignedly. He will tell you that he
      has always known that some day he must wed and do his best to beget a son.
      He held out long enough against this alliance, but now that necessity is
      driving him at last, he goes about it much as he would go about any other
      State affair&mdash;a coronation, a banquet, or a ball. Can you wonder now
      that I would not accept the throne of Babbiano when it was offered me? I
      tell you, Fanfulla, that were I at present in my cousin&rsquo;s shoes, I would
      cast crown and purple at whomsoever had a fancy for them ere they crushed
      the life out of me and left me a poor puppet. Sooner than endure that
      hollow mockery of a life I would become a peasant or a vassal; I would
      delve the earth and lead a humble life, but lead it in my own way, and
      thank God for the freedom of it; choose my own comrades; live as I list,
      where I list; love as I list, where I list, and die when God pleases with
      the knowledge that my life had not been altogether barren. And that poor
      girl, Fanfulla! Think of her. She is to be joined in loveless union to
      such a gross, unfeeling clod as Gian Maria. Have you no pity for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanfulla sighed, his brow clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so dull but that I can see why you should reason thus to-day,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;These thoughts have come to you since you have seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franceseo sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he made answer wistfully. &ldquo;In the few moments that we talked
      together, in the little time that I beheld her, it may be that she dealt
      me a wound far deeper than the one to which she so mercifully sought to
      minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now for all that in what the Lord of Aquila said touching the projected
      union there was a deal of justice, yet when he asserted that the chief
      actors were to have no opportunity of selecting for themselves, he said
      too much. That opportunity they were to have. It occurred three days later
      at Urbino, when the Duke and Valentina were brought together at the
      banquet of welcome given by Guidobaldo to his intended nephew-in-law. The
      sight of her resplendent beauty came as a joyful shock to Gian Maria, and
      filled him with as much impatience to possess her as did his own gross
      ugliness render him offensive in her eyes. Averse had she been to this
      wedding from the moment that it had been broached to her. The sight of
      Gian Maria completed her loathing of the part assigned her, and in her
      heart she registered a vow that sooner than become the Duchess of
      Babbiano, she would return to her Convent of Santa Sofia and take the
      veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria sat beside her at the banquet, and in the intervals of eating&mdash;which
      absorbed him mightily&mdash;he whispered compliments at which she
      shuddered and turned pale. The more strenuously did he strive to please,
      in his gross and clumsy fashion, the more did he succeed in repelling and
      disgusting her, until, in the end, with all his fatuousness, he came to
      deem her oddly cold. Of this, anon, he made complaint to that magnificent
      prince, her uncle. But Guidobaldo scoffed at his qualms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you account my niece a peasant girl?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Would you have her
      smirk and squirm at every piece of flattery you utter? So that she weds
      your Highness what shall the rest signify?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would she loved me a little,&rdquo; complained Gian Maria foolishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo looked him over with an eye that smiled inscrutably, and it may
      have crossed his mind that this coarse, white-faced Duke was too
      ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt not that she will,&rdquo; he answered, in tones as inscrutable as his
      glance. &ldquo;So that you woo with grace and ardour, what woman could withstand
      your Highness? Be not put off by such modesty as becomes a maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words of Guidobaldo&rsquo;s breathed new courage into him. Nor ever after
      could he think that her coldness was other than a cloak, a sort of
      maidenly garment behind which modesty bade her conceal the inclinations of
      her heart. Reasoning thus, and having in support of it his wondrous
      fatuity, it so befell that the more she shunned and avoided him, the more
      did he gather conviction of the intensity of her affection; the more
      loathing she betrayed, the more proof did it afford him of the consuming
      quality of her passion. In the end, he went even so far as to applaud and
      esteem in her this very maidenly conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were hunting-parties, hawking-parties, water-parties, banquets,
      comedies, balls, and revels of every description, and for a week all went
      well at Urbino. Then, as suddenly as if a cannon had been fired upon the
      Palace, the festivities were interrupted. The news that an envoy of Caesar
      Borgia&rsquo;s was at Babbiano with a message from his master came like a cold
      douche upon Gian Maria. It was borne to him in a letter from Fabrizio da
      Lodi, imploring his immediate return to treat with this plenipotentiary of
      Valentino&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      No longer did he disregard the peril that threatened him from the
      all-conquering Borgia, no longer deem exaggerated by his advisers the
      cause for fear. This sudden presence of Valentino&rsquo;s messenger, coming,
      too, at a time when it would almost seem as if the impending union with
      Urbino had spurred the Borgia to act before the alliance was established,
      filled him with apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the princely chambers that had been set aside for his use during
      his visit to Urbino he discussed the tragic news with the two nobles who
      had accompanied him&mdash;Alvaro de Alvari and Gismondo Santi&mdash;and
      both of them, whilst urging him to take the advice of Lodi and return at
      once, urged him, too, to establish his betrothal ere he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring the matter to an issue at once, your Highness,&rdquo; said Santi, &ldquo;and
      thus you will go back to Babbiano well-armed to meet the Duca Valentino&rsquo;s
      messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Readily accepting this advice, Gian Maria went in quest of Guidobaldo, and
      laid before him his proposals, together with the news which had arrived
      and which was the cause of the haste he now manifested. Guidobaldo
      listened gravely. In its way the news affected him as well, for he feared
      the might of Caesar Borgia as much as any man in Italy, and he was, by
      virtue of it, the readier to hasten forward an alliance which should bring
      another of the neighbouring states into the powerful coalition he was
      forming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be as you wish,&rdquo; answered him the gracious Lord of Urbino, &ldquo;and
      the betrothal shall be proclaimed to-day, so that you can bear news of it
      to Valentino&rsquo;s messenger. When you have heard this envoy, deliver him an
      answer of such defiance or such caution as you please. Then return in ten
      days&rsquo; time to Urbino, and all shall be ready for the nuptials. But, first
      of all, go you and tell Monna Valentina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confident of success, Gian Maria obeyed his host, and went in quest of the
      lady. He gained her ante-chamber, and thence he despatched an idling page
      to request of her the honour of an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the youth passed through the door that led to the room beyond, Gian
      Maria caught for a moment the accents of an exquisite male voice singing a
      love-song to the accompaniment of a lute.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Una donna più bella assai che &lsquo;l sole...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      came the words of Petrarch, and he heard them still, though muffled, for a
      moment or two after the boy had gone. Then it ceased abruptly, and a pause
      followed, at the end of which the page returned. Raising the portière of
      blue and gold, he invited Gian Maria to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a room that spoke with eloquence of the wealth and refinement of
      Montefeltro, from the gilding and ultramarine of the vaulted ceiling with
      its carved frieze of delicately inlaid woodwork, to the priceless
      tapestries beneath it. Above a crimson prie-dieu hung a silver crucifix,
      the exquisite workmanship of the famous Anichino of Ferrara. Yonder stood
      an inlaid cabinet, surmounted by a crystal mirror and some wonders of
      Murano glass. There was a picture by Mantegna, some costly cameos and
      delicate enamels, an abundance of books, a dulcimer which a fair-haired
      page was examining with inquisitive eyes, and by a window on the right
      stood a very handsome harp that Guidobaldo had bought his niece in Venice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that choice apartment of hers the Duke found Valentina surrounded by
      her ladies, Peppe the fool, a couple of pages, and a half-dozen gentlemen
      of her uncle&rsquo;s court. One of these&mdash;that same Gonzaga who had
      escorted her from the Convent of Santa Sofia&mdash;most splendidly arrayed
      in white taby, his vest and doublet rich with gold, sat upon a low stool,
      idly fingering the lute in his lap, from which Gian Maria inferred that
      his had been the voice that had reached him in the ante-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Duke&rsquo;s advent they all rose saving Valentina and received him with
      a ceremony that somewhat chilled his ardour. He advanced; then halted
      clumsily, and in a clumsy manner framed a request that he might speak with
      her alone. In a tired, long-suffering way she dismissed that court of
      hers, and Gian Maria stood waiting until the last of them had passed out
      through the tall windows that abutted on to a delightful terrace, where,
      in the midst of a green square, a marble fountain flashed and glimmered in
      the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, when they were at last alone, &ldquo;I have news from Babbiano
      that demands my instant return.&rdquo; And he approached her by another step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth he was a dull-witted fellow or else too blinded by fatuity to see
      and interpret aright the sudden sparkle in her eye, the sudden,
      unmistakable expression of relief that spread itself upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she answered, in a low, collected voice, &ldquo;we shall grieve at
      your departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fool of a Duke that he was! Blind, crass and most fatuous of wooers! Had
      he been bred in courts and his ears attuned to words that meant nothing,
      that were but the empty echoes of what should have been meant; was he so
      new to courtesies in which the heart had no share, that those words of
      Valentina&rsquo;s must bring him down upon his knees beside her, to take her
      dainty fingers in his fat hands, and to become transformed into a boorish
      lover of the most outrageous type?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you so?&rdquo; he lisped, his glance growing mighty amorous. &ldquo;Shall you
      indeed grieve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose abruptly to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg that your Highness will rise,&rdquo; she enjoined him coldly, a coldness
      which changed swiftly to alarm as her endeavours to release her hand
      proved vain. For despite her struggles he held on stoutly. This was mere
      coyness, he assured himself, mere maidenly artifice which he must bear
      with until he had overcome it for all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I implore you!&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Bethink you of where you are&mdash;of
      who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here will I stay until the crack of doom,&rdquo; he answered, with an odd
      mixture of humour, ardour and ferocity, &ldquo;unless you consent to listen to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to listen, my lord,&rdquo; she answered, without veiling a
      repugnance that he lacked the wit to see. &ldquo;But it is not necessary that
      you should hold my hand, nor fitting that you should kneel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not fitting?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Lady, you do not apprehend me rightly. Is it
      not fitting that all of us&mdash;be we princes or vassals&mdash;shall
      kneel sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your prayers, my lord, yes, most fitting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is not a man at his prayers when he woos? What fitter shrine in all
      the world than his mistress&rsquo;s feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Release me,&rdquo; she commanded, still struggling. &ldquo;Your Highness grows
      tiresome and ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ridiculous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His great, sensual mouth fell open. His white cheeks grew mottled, and his
      little eyes looked up with a mighty evil gleam in their cruel blue. A
      moment he stayed so, then he rose up. He released her hands as she had
      bidden him, but he clutched her arms instead, which was yet worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valentina,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that was far from steady, &ldquo;why do you use
      me thus unkindly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not,&rdquo; she protested wearily, drawing back with a shudder from
      the white face that was so near her own, inspiring her with a loathing she
      could not repress. &ldquo;I would not have your Highness look foolish, and you
      cannot conceive how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you conceive how deeply, how passionately I love you?&rdquo; he broke in,
      his grasp tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, you are hurting me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you not hurting me?&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;What is a pinched arm when
      compared with such wounds as your eyes are dealing me? Are you not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had twisted from his grasp, and in a bound she had reached the
      window-door through which her attendants had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valentina!&rdquo; he cried, as he sprang after her, and it was more like the
      growl of a beast than the cry of a lover. He caught her, and with scant
      ceremony he dragged her back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, her latent loathing, contempt and indignation rose up in arms.
      Never had she heard tell of a woman of her rank being used in this
      fashion. She abhorred him, yet she had spared him the humiliation of
      hearing it from her lips, intending to fight for her liberty with her
      uncle. But now, since he handled her as though she had been a
      serving-wench; since he appeared to know nothing of the deference due to
      her, nothing of the delicacies of people well-born and well-bred, she
      would endure his odious love-making no further. Since he elected to pursue
      his wooing like a clown, the high-spirited daughter of Urbino promised
      herself that in like fashion would she deal with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swinging herself free from his grasp a second time, she caught him a
      stinging buffet on the ducal cheek which&mdash;so greatly did it take him
      by surprise&mdash;all but sent him sprawling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;This indignity to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what indignities have not I suffered at your hands?&rdquo; she retorted,
      with a fierceness of glance before which he recoiled. And as she now
      towered before him, a beautiful embodiment of wrath, he knew not whether
      he loved her more than he feared her, yet the desire to possess her and to
      tame her was strong within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a baggage of your camps,&rdquo; she questioned furiously, &ldquo;to be so
      handled by you? Do you forget that I am the niece of Guidobaldo, a lady of
      the house of Rovere, and that from my cradle I have known naught but the
      respect of all men, be they born never so high? That to such by my birth I
      have the right? Must I tell you in plain words, sir, that though born to a
      throne, your manners are those of a groom? And must I tell you, ere you
      will realise it, that no man to whom with my own lips I have not given the
      right, shall set hands upon me as you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flashed, her voice rose, and higher raged the storm; and Gian
      Maria was so tossed and shattered by it that he could but humbly sue for
      pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall it signify that I am a Duke,&rdquo; he pleaded timidly, &ldquo;since I am
      become a lover? What is a Duke then? He is but a man, and as the meanest
      of his subjects his love must take expression. For what does love know of
      rank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was moving towards the window again, and for all that he dared not a
      second time arrest her by force, he sought by words to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I implore you to hear me. In another hour I
      shall be in the saddle, on my way to Babbiano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; she answered him, &ldquo;is the best news I have heard since your
      coming.&rdquo; And without waiting for his reply, she stepped through the open
      window on to the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second he hesitated, a sense of angry humiliation oppressing his
      wits. Then he started to follow her; but as he reached the window the
      little crook-backed figure of Ser Peppe stood suddenly before him with a
      tinkle of bells, and a mocking grin illumining his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the way, fool,&rdquo; growled the angry Duke. But the odd figure in its
      motley of red and black continued where it stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is Madonna Valentina you seek,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;behold her yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gian Maria, following the indication of Peppe&rsquo;s lean finger, saw that
      she had rejoined her ladies and that thus his opportunity of speaking with
      her was at an end. He turned his shoulder upon the jester, and moved
      ponderously towards the door by which he had originally entered the room.
      It had been well for Ser Peppe had he let him go. But the fool, who loved
      his mistress dearly, and had many of the instincts of the faithful dog,
      loving where she loved and hating where she hated, could not repress the
      desire to send a gibe after the retreating figure, and inflict another
      wound in that much wounded spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find it a hard road to Madonna&rsquo;s heart, Magnificent,&rdquo; he called after
      him. &ldquo;Where your wisdom is blind be aided by the keen eyes of folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke stood still. A man more dignified would have left that
      treacherous tongue unheeded. But Dignity and Gian Maria were strangers. He
      turned, and eyed the figure that now followed him into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have knowledge to sell,&rdquo; he guessed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowledge I have&mdash;a vast store&mdash;but none for sale, Lord Duke.
      Such as imports you I will bestow if you ask me, for no more than the joy
      of beholding you smile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; the Duke bade him, without relaxing the grimness that tightened
      his flabby face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peppe bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were an easy thing, most High and Mighty, to win the love of Madonna
      if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. E dunque! If&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had the noble countenance, the splendid height, the shapely limbs,
      the courtly speech and princely manner of one I wot of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you deriding me?&rdquo; the Duke questioned, unbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, Highness! I do but tell you how it were possible that my lady
      might come to love you. Had you those glorious attributes of him I speak
      of, and of whom she dreams, it might be easy. But since God fashioned you
      such as you are&mdash;gross of countenance, fat and stunted of shape,
      boorish of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a roar the infuriated Duke was upon him. But the fool, as nimble of
      legs as he was of tongue, eluded the vicious grasp of those fat hands, and
      leaping through the window, ran to the shelter of his mistress&rsquo;s
      petticoats.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. GONZAGA THE INSIDIOUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well indeed had it been for Ser Peppe had he restrained his malicious mood
      and curbed the mocking speech that had been as vinegar to Gian Maria&rsquo;s
      wounds. For when Gian Maria was sore he was wont to be vindictive, and on
      the present occasion he was something even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There abode with him the memory of the fool&rsquo;s words, and the suggestion
      that in the heart of Valentina was framed the image of some other man.
      Now, loving her, in his own coarse way, and as he understood love, the
      rejected Duke waxed furiously jealous of this other at whose existence
      Peppe had hinted. This unknown stood in his path to Valentina, and to
      clear that path it suggested itself to Gian Maria that the simplest method
      was to remove the obstacle. But first he must discover it, and to this he
      thought, with a grim smile, the fool might&mdash;willy-nilly&mdash;help
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his own apartments, and whilst the preparations for his
      departure were toward, he bade Alvaro summon Martin Armstadt&mdash;the
      captain of his guard. To the latter his orders were short and secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take four men,&rdquo; he bade him, &ldquo;and remain in Urbino after I am gone.
      Discover the haunts of Peppe the fool. Seize him, and bring him after me.
      See that you do it diligently, and let no suspicion of your task arise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bravo&mdash;he was little better, for all that he commanded the guards
      of the Duke of Babbiano&mdash;bowed, and answered in his foreign, guttural
      voice that his Highness should be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter Gian Maria made shift to depart. He took his leave of
      Guidobaldo, promising to return within a few days for the nuptials, and
      leaving an impression upon the mind of his host that his interview with
      Valentina had been very different from the actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from Valentina herself that Guidobaldo was to learn, after Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s departure, the true nature of that interview, and what had passed
      between his niece and his guest. She sought him out in his closet, whither
      he had repaired, driven thither by the demon of gout that already
      inhabited his body, and was wont to urge him at times to isolate himself
      from his court. She found him reclining upon a couch, seeking distraction
      in a volume of the prose works of Piccinino. He was a handsome man, of
      excellent shape, scarce thirty years of age. His face was pale, and there
      were dark circles round his eyes, and lines of pain about his strong
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up at her advent, and setting his book upon the table beside him,
      he listened to her angry complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, the courtly Montefeltro inclined to anger upon learning of the
      roughness with which Gian Maria had borne himself. But presently he
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When all is said, I see in this no great cause for indignation,&rdquo; he
      assured her. &ldquo;I acknowledge that it may lack the formality that should
      attend the addresses of a man in the Duke&rsquo;s position to a lady in yours.
      But since he is to wed you, and that soon, why be angered at that he seeks
      to pay his court like any other man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have talked in vain, then,&rdquo; she answered petulantly, &ldquo;and I am
      misunderstood. I do not intend to wed this ducal clod you have chosen to
      be my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo stared at her with brows raised, and wonder in his fine eyes.
      Then he shrugged his shoulders a trifle wearily. This handsome and
      well-beloved Guidobaldo was very much a prince, so schooled to princely
      ways as to sometimes forget that he was a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We forgive much to the impetuousness of youth,&rdquo; said he, very coldly.
      &ldquo;But there are bounds to the endurance of every one of us. As your uncle
      and your prince, I claim a double duty from you, and you owe a double
      allegiance to my wishes. By my twofold authority I have commanded you to
      wed with Gian Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The princess in her was all forgotten, and it was just the woman who
      answered him, in a voice of protest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Highness, I do not love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade of impatience crossed his lofty face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not remember,&rdquo; he made answer wearily, &ldquo;that I loved your aunt. Yet
      we were wed, and through habit came to love each other and to be happy
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can understand that Monna Elizabetta should have come to love you,&rdquo; she
      returned. &ldquo;You are not as Gian Maria. You were not fat and ugly, stupid
      and cruel, as is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an appeal that might have won its way to a man&rsquo;s heart through the
      ever-ready channel of his vanity. But it did not so with Guidobaldo. He
      only shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is not one that I will argue. It were unworthy in us both.
      Princes, my child, are not as ordinary folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what are they different?&rdquo; she flashed back at him. &ldquo;Do they not hunger
      and thirst as ordinary folk? Are they not subject to the same ills; do
      they not experience the same joys? Are they not born, and do they not die,
      just as ordinary folk? In what, then, lies this difference that forbids
      them to mate as ordinary folk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo tossed his arms to Heaven, his eyes full of a consternation
      that clearly defied utterance. The violence of his gesture drew a gasp of
      pain from him. At last, when he had mastered it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are different,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in that their lives are not their own to
      dispose of as they will. They belong to the State which they were born to
      govern, and in nothing else does this become of so much importance as in
      their mating. It behoves them to contract such alliances as shall redound
      to the advantage of their people.&rdquo; A toss of her auburn head was
      Valentina&rsquo;s interpolation, but her uncle continued relentlessly in his
      cold, formal tones&mdash;such tones as those in which he might have
      addressed an assembly of his captains:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the present instance we are threatened&mdash;Babbiano and Urbino&mdash;by
      a common foe. And whilst divided, neither of us could withstand him,
      united, we shall combine to his overthrow. Therefore does this alliance
      become necessary&mdash;imperative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not apprehend the necessity,&rdquo; she answered, in a voice that breathed
      defiance. &ldquo;If such an alliance as you speak of is desirable, why may it
      not be made a purely political one&mdash;such a one, for instance, as now
      binds Perugia and Camerino to you? What need to bring me into question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little knowledge of history would afford you an answer. Such political
      alliances are daily made, and daily broken when more profit offers in
      another quarter. But cemented by marriage, the tie, whilst continuing
      political, becomes also one of blood. In the case of Urbino and Babbiano
      it enters also into consideration that I have no son. It might well be,
      Valentina,&rdquo; he pursued, with a calculating coldness that revolted her,
      &ldquo;that a son of yours would yet more strongly link the two duchies. In time
      both might become united under him into one great power that might vie
      successfully with any in Italy. Now leave me, child. As you see, I am
      suffering, and when it is thus with me, and this evil tyrant has me in its
      clutches, I prefer to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and whilst his eyes were upon hers, hers were upon the
      ground in avoidance of his glance. A frown marred her white brow, her lips
      were set and her hands clenched. Pity for his physical ills fought a while
      with pity for her own mental torment. At last she threw back her beautiful
      head, and the manner of that action was instinct with insubordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It grieves me to harass your Highness in such a season,&rdquo; she assured him,
      &ldquo;but I must beg your indulgence. These things may be as you say. Your
      plans may be the noblest that were ever conceived, since to their
      consummation would be entailed the sacrifice of your own flesh and blood&mdash;in
      the person of your niece. But I will have no part in them. It may be that
      I lack a like nobility of soul; it may be that I am all unworthy of the
      high station to which I was born, through no fault of my own. And so, my
      lord,&rdquo; she ended, her voice, her face, her gesture, all imparting an
      irrevocable finality to her words, &ldquo;I will not wed this Duke of Babbiano&mdash;no,
      not to cement alliances with a hundred duchies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valentina!&rdquo; he exclaimed, roused out of his wonted calm. &ldquo;Do you forget
      that you are my niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you appear to have forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These woman&rsquo;s whims&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when she interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they will serve to remind you that I am a woman, and perhaps if
      you remember that, you may consider how very natural it is that, being a
      woman, I should refuse to wed for&mdash;for political ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your chamber,&rdquo; he commanded, now thoroughly aroused. &ldquo;And on your
      knees beg Heaven&rsquo;s grace to help you to see your duty, since no words of
      mine prevail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that the Duchess were returned from Mantua,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;The good
      Monna Elizabetta might melt you to some pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monna Elizabetta is too dutiful herself to do aught but urge you to
      dutifulness. There, child,&rdquo; he added, in a more wheedling tone, &ldquo;set aside
      this disobedient mood, which is unlike you and becomes you ill. You shall
      be wed with a splendour and magnificence that will set every princess in
      Italy green with envy. Your dowry is set at fifty thousand ducats, and
      Giuliano della Rovere shall pronounce the benediction. Already I have sent
      orders to Ferrara, to the incomparable Anichino, for the majestate girdle;
      I will send to Venice for gold leaf and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you not heed me that I will not wed?&rdquo; she broke in with passionate
      calm, her face white, her bosom heaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, leaning heavily upon a gold-headed cane, and looked at her a
      moment without speaking, his brows contracted. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your betrothal to Gian Maria is proclaimed,&rdquo; he announced in a voice cold
      with finality. &ldquo;I have passed my word to the Duke, and your marriage shall
      take place so soon as he returns. Now go. Such scenes as these are
      wearisome to a sick man, and they are undignified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your Highness,&rdquo; she began, an imploring note now taking the place
      that lately had been held by defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he blazed, stamping his foot, and then to save his dignity&mdash;for
      he feared that she might still remain&mdash;he himself turned on his heel
      and passed from the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to herself, she stood there a moment, allowed a sigh to escape her,
      and brushed an angry tear from her brown eyes. Then, with a sudden
      movement that seemed to imply suppression of her mood, she walked to the
      door by which she entered, and left the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went down the long gallery, whose walls glowed with the new frescoes
      from the wonder-working brush of Andrea Mantegna; she crossed her
      ante-chamber and gained the very room where some hours ago she had
      received the insult of Gian Maria&rsquo;s odious advances. She passed through
      the now empty room, and stepped out on to the terrace that overlooked the
      paradise-like gardens of the Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by the fountain stood a white marble seat, over which, earlier that
      day, one of her women had thrown a cloak of crimson velvet. There she now
      sat herself to think out the monstrous situation that beset her. The air
      was warm and balmy and heavy with the scent of flowers from the garden
      below. The splashing of the fountain seemed to soothe her, and for a
      little while her eyes were upon that gleaming water, which rose high in a
      crystal column, then broke and fell, a shower of glittering jewels, into
      the broad marble basin. Then, her eyes growing tired, they strayed to the
      marble balustrade, where a peacock strode with overweening dignity; they
      passed on to the gardens below, gay with early blossoms, in their stately
      frames of tall, boxwood hedges, and flanked by myrtles and tall cypresses
      standing gaunt and black against the deep saffron of the vesper sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saving the splashing of the fountain, and the occasional harsh scream of
      the peacock, all was at peace, as if by contrast with the tumult that
      raged in Valentina&rsquo;s soul. Then another sound broke the stillness&mdash;a
      soft step, crunching the gravel of the walk. She turned, and behind her
      stood the magnificent Gonzaga, a smile that at once reflected pleasure and
      surprise upon his handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, Madonna?&rdquo; he said, in accents of mild wonder, his fingers softly
      stirring the strings of the lute he carried, and without which he seldom
      appeared about the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; she answered, and her tone was the tone of one whose
      thoughts are taken up with other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance moved away from him again, and in a moment it seemed as if she
      had forgotten his presence, so absorbed grew the expression of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gonzaga was not easily discouraged. Patience was the one virtue that
      Valentina more than any woman&mdash;and there had been many in his young
      life&mdash;had inculcated into a soul that in the main was anything but
      virtuous. He came a step nearer, and leant lightly against the edge of her
      seat, his shapely legs crossed, his graceful body inclining ever so
      slightly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pensive, Madonna,&rdquo; he murmured, in his rich, caressing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; she reproved him, but in a mild tone, &ldquo;do you intrude upon my
      thoughts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they seem sad thoughts, Madonna.&rdquo; he answered, glibly, &ldquo;and I
      were a poor friend did I not seek to rouse you out of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are that, Gonzaga?&rdquo; she questioned, without looking at him. &ldquo;You are
      my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to quiver and then draw himself upright, whilst across his face
      there swept a shade of something that may have been good or bad or partly
      both. Then he leant down until his head came very near her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo; quoth he. &ldquo;Ah, more than your friend. Count me your very
      slave, Madonna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him now, and in his countenance she saw a reflection of the
      ardour that had spoken in his voice. In his eyes there was a glance of
      burning intensity. She drew away from him, and at first he accounted
      himself repulsed, but pointing to the space she had left:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit here beside me, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she said quietly, and he, scarce crediting
      his own good fortune that so much favour should be showered upon him,
      obeyed her in a half-timid fashion that was at odd variance with his late
      bold words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed lightly, perhaps to cover the embarrassment that beset him, and
      dropping his jewelled cap, he flung one white-cased leg over the other and
      took his lute in his lap, his fingers again wandering to the strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a new song, Madonna,&rdquo; he announced, with a gaiety that was
      obviously forced. &ldquo;It is in ottava rima, a faint echo of the immortal
      Niccolo Correggio, composed in honour of one whose description is beyond
      the flight of human song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you sing of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no better than an acknowledgment of the impossibility to sing of
      her. Thus&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And striking a chord or two, he began, a mezza
      voce:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Quando sorriderán&rsquo; in ciel
      Gli occhi tuoi ai santi&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She laid a hand upon his arm to stay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;I am in no humour for your song, sweet
      though I doubt not that it be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade of disappointment and ruffled vanity crossed his face. Women had
      been wont to listen greedily to his strambotti, enthralled by the cunning
      of the words and the seductive sweetness of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, never look so glum,&rdquo; she cried, smiling now at his crestfallen air.
      &ldquo;If I have not hearkened now, I will again. Forgive me, good Gonzaga,&rdquo; she
      begged him, with a sweetness no man could have resisted. And then a sigh
      fluttered from her lips; a sound that was like a sob came after it, and
      her hand closed upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are breaking my heart, my friend. Oh, that you had left me at peace
      in the Convent of Santa Sofia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to her, all solicitude and gentleness, to inquire the reason of
      her outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this odious alliance into which they seek to force me with that man
      from Babbiano. I have told Guidobaldo that I will not wed this Duke. But
      as profitably might I tell Fate that I will not die. The one is as
      unheeding as the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga sighed profoundly, in sympathy, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a grief to which he could not minister, a grievance that he could
      do nothing to remove. She turned from him with a gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sigh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and you bewail the cruelty of the fate in
      store for me. But you can do nothing for me. You are all words, Gonzaga.
      You can call yourself more than my friend&mdash;my very slave. Yet, when I
      need your help, what do you offer me? A sigh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, you are unjust,&rdquo; he was quick to answer, with some heat. &ldquo;I did
      not dream&mdash;I did not dare to dream&mdash;that it was my help you
      sought. My sympathy, I believed, was all that you invited, and so, lest I
      should seem presumptuous, it was all I offered. But if my help you need;
      if you seek a means to evade this alliance that you rightly describe as
      odious, such help as it lies in a man&rsquo;s power to render shall you have
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke almost fiercely and with a certain grim confidence, for all that
      as yet no plan had formed itself in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, had a course been clear to him, there had been perhaps less
      confidence in his tone, for, after all, he was not by nature a man of
      action, and his character was the very reverse of valiant. Yet so
      excellent an actor was he as to deceive even himself by his acting, and in
      this suggestion of some vague fine deeds that he would do, he felt himself
      stirred by a sudden martial ardour, and capable of all. He was stirred,
      too, by the passion with which Valentina&rsquo;s beauty filled him&mdash;a
      passion that went nearer to making a man of him than Nature had succeeded
      in doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That now, in the hour of her need, she should turn so readily to him for
      assistance, he accepted as proof that she was not deaf to the voice of
      this great love he bore her, but of which he never yet had dared to show a
      sign. The passing jelousy that he had entertained for that wounded knight
      they had met at Acquasparta was laid to rest by her present attitude
      towards him, the knight, himself forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Valentina, she listened to his ready speech and earnest tone with
      growing wonder both at him and at herself. Her own words had been little
      more than a petulant outburst. Of actually finding a way to elude her
      uncle&rsquo;s wishes she had no thought&mdash;unless it lay in carrying out that
      threat of hers to take the veil. Now, however, that Gonzaga spoke so
      bravely of doing what man could do to help her to evade that marriage, the
      thought of active resistance took an inviting shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      A timid hope&mdash;a hope that was afraid of being shattered before it
      grew to any strength&mdash;peeped now from the wondering eyes she turned
      on her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a way, Gonzaga?&rdquo; she asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now during that pause his mind had been very busy. Something of a poet, he
      was blessed with wits of a certain quickness, and was a man of very ready
      fancy. Like an inspiration an idea had come to him; out of this had sprung
      another, and yet another, until a chain of events by which the frustration
      of the schemes of Babbiano and Urbino might be accomplished, was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said slowly, his eyes upon the ground, &ldquo;that I know a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her glance was now eager, her lip tremulous, and her face a little pale.
      She leant towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she besought him feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his lute on the seat beside him, and his eyes looked round in
      apprehensive survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;There are too many ears in the Palace of Urbino.
      Will it please you to walk in the gardens? I will tell you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rose together, so ready was her assent. They looked at each other for
      a second. Then, side by side, they passed down the wide marble steps that
      led from the terrace to the box-flanked walks of the gardens. Here, among
      the lengthening shadows, they paced in silence for a while, what time
      Gonzaga sought for words in which to propound his plan. At length, grown
      impatient, Valentina urged him with a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I counsel, Madonna,&rdquo; he answered her, &ldquo;is open defiance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a course I am already pursuing. But whither will it lead me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mean the mere defiance of words&mdash;mere protestations that
      you will not wed Gian Maria. Listen, Madonna! The Castle of Roccaleone is
      your property. It is perhaps the stoutest fortress in all Italy, to-day.
      Lightly garrisoned and well-provisioned it might withstand a year&rsquo;s
      siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him, having guessed already the proposal in his mind, and
      for all that at first her eyes looked startled, yet presently they kindled
      to a light of daring that augured well for a very stout adventure. It was
      a wildly romantic notion, this of Gonzaga&rsquo;s, worthy of a poet&rsquo;s perfervid
      brain, and yet it attracted her by its unprecedented flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it be done?&rdquo; she wondered, her eyes sparkling at the anticipation
      of such a deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could, indeed it could,&rdquo; he answered, with an eagerness no whit less
      than her own. &ldquo;Immure yourself in Roccaleone, and thence hurl defiance at
      Urbino and Babbiano, refusing to surrender until they grant your terms&mdash;that
      you are to marry as you list.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will help me in this?&rdquo; she questioned, her mind&mdash;in its
      innocence&mdash;inclining more and more to the mad project.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my strength and wit,&rdquo; he answered, readily and gallantly. &ldquo;I
      will so victual the place that it shall be able to stand siege for a whole
      year, should the need arise, and I will find you the men to arm it&mdash;a
      score will, I should think, be ample for our needs, since it is mainly
      upon the natural strength of the place that we rely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I shall need a captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga made her a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will honour me with the office, Madonna, I shall serve you loyally
      whilst I have life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile quivered for a second on her lips, but was gone ere the courtier
      had straightened himself from his bow, for far was it from her wishes to
      wound his spirit. But the notion of this scented fop in the role of
      captain, ruling a handful of rough mercenaries, and directing the
      operations for the resistance of an assiduous siege, touched her with its
      ludicrous note. Yet, if she refused him this, it was more than likely he
      would deem himself offended, and refuse to advance their plans. It crossed
      her mind&mdash;in the full confidence of youth&mdash;that if he should
      fail her when the hour of action came, she was of stout enough heart to
      aid herself. And so she consented, whereat again he bowed, this time in
      gratitude. And then a sudden thought occurred to her, and with it came
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for all this, Gonzaga&mdash;for the men and the victualling&mdash;money
      will be needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let my friendship be proven also in that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she interrupted him, struck suddenly with a solution to the riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she exclaimed. His face fell a little. He had hoped to place her
      in his debt in every possible way, yet here was one in which she raised a
      barrier. Upon her head she wore a fret of gold, so richly laced with
      pearls as to be worth a prince&rsquo;s ransom. This she now made haste to
      unfasten with fingers that excitement set a-tremble. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried,
      holding it out to him. &ldquo;Turn that to money, my friend. It should yield you
      ducats enough for this enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It next occurred to her that she could not go alone into that castle with
      just Gonzaga and the men he was about to enrol. His answer came with a
      promptness that showed he had considered, also, that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; he answered her. &ldquo;When the time comes you must select such
      of your ladies&mdash;say three or four&mdash;as appear suitable and have
      your trust. You may take a priest as well, a page or two, and a few
      servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the gloaming, amid the shadows of that old Italian garden, was
      the plot laid by which Valentina was to escape alliance with his Highness
      of Babbiano. But there was more than that in it, although that was all
      that Valentina saw. It was, too, a plot by which she might become the wife
      of Messer Romeo Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an exiled member of that famous Mantua family, which has bred some
      scoundrels and one saint. With the money which, at parting, a doting
      mother had bestowed upon him, he was cutting a brave figure at the Urbino
      court, where he was tolerated by virtue of his kinship with Guidobaldo&rsquo;s
      Duchess, Monna Elizabetta. But his means were running low, and it behoved
      him to turn his attention to such quarters as might yield him profit.
      Being poor-spirited, and&mdash;since his tastes had not inclined that way&mdash;untrained
      in arms, it would have been futile for him to have sought the career
      common to adventurers of his age. Yet an adventurer at heart he was, and
      since the fields of Mars were little suited to his nature, he had long
      pondered upon the possibilities afforded him by the lists of Cupid.
      Guidobaldo&mdash;purely out of consideration for Monna Elizabetta&mdash;had
      shown him a high degree of favour, and upon this he had been vain enough
      to found great hopes&mdash;for Guidobaldo had two nieces. High had these
      hopes run when he was chosen to escort the lovely Valentina della Rovere
      from the Convent of Santa Sofia to her uncle&rsquo;s court. But of late they had
      withered, since he had learnt what were her uncle&rsquo;s plans for this lady&rsquo;s
      future. And now, by her own action, and by the plot into which she had
      entered with him, they rose once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      To thwart Guidobaldo might prove a dangerous thing, and his life might pay
      the forfeit if his schemes miscarried&mdash;clement and merciful though
      Guidobaldo was. But if they succeeded, and if by love or by force he could
      bring Valentina to wed him, he was tolerably confident that Guidobaldo,
      seeing matters had gone too far&mdash;since Gian Maria would certainly
      refuse to wed Gonzaga&rsquo;s widow&mdash;would let them be. To this end no plan
      could be more propitious than that into which he had lured her. Guidobaldo
      might besiege them in Roccaleone and might eventually reduce them by force
      of arms&mdash;a circumstance, however, which, despite his words, he deemed
      extremely remote. But if only he could wed Valentina before they
      capitulated, he thought that he would have little cause to fear any
      consequences of Guidobaldo&rsquo;s wrath. After all, in so far as birth and
      family were concerned, Romeo Gonzaga was nowise the inferior of his
      Highness of Urbino. Guidobaldo had yet another niece, and he might cement
      with her the desired alliance with Babbiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone in the gardens of the Palace, Gonzaga paced after night had fallen,
      and with his eyes to the stars that began to fleck the violet sky, he
      smiled a smile of cunning gratification. He bethought him how well advised
      had been his suggestion that they should take a priest to Roccaleone.
      Unless his prophetic sense led him deeply into error, they would find work
      for that priest before the castle was surrendered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. AMONG THE DREGS OF WINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      And so it befell that whilst by Guidobaldo&rsquo;s orders the preparations for
      Valentina&rsquo;s nuptials went forward with feverish haste&mdash;whilst
      painters, carvers, and artificers in gold and silver applied themselves to
      their hurried tasks; whilst messengers raced to Venice for gold leaf and
      ultramarine for the wedding-chests whilst the nuptial bed was being
      brought from Rome and the chariot from Ferrara; whilst costly stuffs were
      being collected, and the wedding-garments fashioned&mdash;the magnificent
      Romeo Gonzaga was, on his side, as diligently contriving to render vain
      all that toil of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the third day of his conspiring he sat in the room
      allotted to him in the Palace of Urbino, and matured his plans. And so
      well pleased was he with his self-communion that, as he sat at his window,
      there was a contented smile upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He allowed his glance to stray adown the slopes of that arid waste of
      rocks, to the River Metauro, winding its way to the sea, through fertile
      plains, and gleaming here silver and yonder gold in the evening light. Not
      quite so complacently would he have smiled had he deemed the enterprise
      upon which he was engaging to be of that warlike character which he had
      represented to Valentina. He did not want for cunning, nor for judgment of
      the working of human minds, and he very reasonably opined that once the
      Lady Valentina immured herself in Roccaleone and sent word to her uncle
      that she would not wed Gian Maria, nor return to the Court of Urbino until
      he passed her his ducal word that she should hear no more of the union,
      the Duke would be the first to capitulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He contended that this might not happen at once&mdash;nor did he wish it
      to; messages would pass, and Guidobaldo would seek by cajolery to win back
      his niece. This she would resist, and, in the end her uncle would see the
      impassable nature of the situation, and agree to her terms that it might
      be ended. That it should come to arms, and that Guidobaldo should move to
      besiege Roccaleone, he did not for a moment believe&mdash;for what manner
      of ridicule would he not draw upon himself from the neighbouring States?
      At the worst, even if a siege there was, it would never be carried out
      with the rigour of ordinary warfare; there would be no assaults, no
      bombarding; it would be a simple investment, with the object of
      intercepting resources, so as to starve the garrison into submission&mdash;for
      they would never dream of such victualling as Gonzaga was preparing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus communed Gonzaga with himself, and the smile enlivening the corners
      of his weak mouth grew more thoughtful. He dreamed great dreams that
      evening; he had wondrous visions of a future princely power that should
      come to be his own by virtue of this alliance that he was so skilfully
      encompassing&mdash;a fool in a fool&rsquo;s paradise, with his folly for only
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all that, his dreams were wondrous sweet to indulge and his
      visions truly alluring to contemplate. There were plans to be formed and
      means to be devised for the flight to Roccaleone. There were calculations
      to be made; the estimating of victuals, arms, and men; and once these
      calculations were complete, there were all these things to be obtained.
      The victuals he had already provided for, whilst of arms he had no need to
      think; Roccaleone should be well stocked with them. But the finding of the
      men gave him some concern. He had decided to enrol a score, which was
      surely the smallest number with which he could make a fair show of being
      martially in earnest. But even though the number was modest, where was he
      to find twenty fellows who reeked so little of their lives as to embark
      upon such an enterprise&mdash;even if lured by generous pay&mdash;and
      thereby incur the ducal displeasure of Guidobaido?
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed himself with sober rigour for once in his foppish life, and
      descended, after night had fallen, to a tavern in a poor street behind the
      Duomo, hoping that there, among the dregs of wine, he might find what he
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      By great good fortune he chanced upon an old freebooting captain, who once
      had been a meaner sort of condottiero, but who was sorely reduced by bad
      fortune and bad wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tavern was a dingy, cut-throat place, which the delicate Gonzaga had
      not entered without a tremor, invoking the saints&rsquo; protection, and
      crossing himself ere he set foot across the threshold. Some pieces of goat
      were being cooked on the embers, in a great fireplace at the end of the
      room farthest from the door. Before this, Ser Luciano&mdash;the taverner&mdash;squatted
      on his heels and fanned so diligently that a cloud of ashes rose ceiling
      high and spread itself, together with the noisome smoke, throughout the
      squalid chamber. A brass lamp swung from the ceiling, and shone freely
      through that smoke, as shines the moon through an evening mist. So foully
      stank the place that at first Gonzaga was moved to get him thence. Only
      the reflection that nowhere in Urbino was he as likely as here to find the
      thing he sought, impelled him to stifle his natural squeamishness and
      remain. He slipped upon some grease, and barely saved himself from
      measuring his length upon that filthy floor, a matter which provoked a
      malicious guffaw from a tattered giant who watched with interest his
      mincing advent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perspiring, and with nerves unstrung, the courtier picked his way to a
      table by the wall, and seated himself upon the coarse deal bench before
      it, praying that he might be left its sole occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the opposite wall hung a blackened crucifix and a small holy-water
      stoup that had been dry for a generation, and was now a receptacle for
      dust and a withered sprig of rosemary. Immediately beneath this&mdash;in
      the company of a couple of tatterdemalions worthy of him&mdash;sat the
      giant who had mocked his escape from falling, and as Gonzaga took his seat
      he heard the fellow&rsquo;s voice, guttural, bottle-thickened and contentious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this wine, Luciano? Sangue della Madonna! Will you bring it before
      dropping dead, pig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga shuddered and would have crossed himself again for protection
      against what seemed a very devil incarnate, but that the ruffian&rsquo;s
      blood-shot eye was set upon him in a stony stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come, cavaliere, I come,&rdquo; cried the timid host, leaping to his feet,
      and leaving the goat to burn while he ministered to the giant&rsquo;s
      unquenchable thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      The title caused Gonzaga to start, and he bent his eyes again on the man&rsquo;s
      face. He found it villainous of expression, inflamed and blotched; the
      hair hung matted about a bullet head, and the eyes glared fiercely from
      either side of a pendulous nose. Of the knightly rank by which the
      taverner addressed him the fellow bore no outward signs. Arms he carried,
      it is true; a sword and dagger at his belt, whilst beside him on the table
      stood a rusty steel-cap. But these warlike tools served only to give him
      the appearance of a roving masnadiero or a cut-throat for hire. Presently
      abandoning the comtemplation of Gonzaga he turned to his companions, and
      across to the listener floated a coarse and boasting tale of a plunderous
      warfare in Sicily ten years agone. Gonzaga became excited. It seemed
      indeed as if this were man who might be useful to him. He made pretence to
      sip the wine Luciano had brought him, and listened avidly to that
      swashbuckling story, from which it appeared that this knave had once been
      better circumstanced and something of a leader. Intently he listened, and
      wondered whether such men as he boasted he had led in that campaign were
      still to be found and could be brought together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of perhaps a half-hour the two companions of that thirsty giant
      rose and took their leave of him. They cast a passing glance upon Gonzaga,
      and were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while he hesitated. The ruffian seemed to have lapsed into a
      reverie, or else he slept with open eyes. Calling up his courage the
      gallant rose at last and moved across the room. All unversed in tavern
      ways was the magnificent Gonzaga, and he who at court, in ballroom or in
      antechamber, was a very mirror of all the graces of a courtier, felt
      awkward here and ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, summoning his wits to his aid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good sir,&rdquo; said he, with some timidity, &ldquo;will you do me the honour to
      share a flagon with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ruffian&rsquo;s eye, which but a moment back had looked vacuous and
      melancholy, now quickened until it seemed ablaze. He raised his bloodshot
      orbs and boldly encountered Gonzaga&rsquo;s uneasy glance. His lips fell apart
      with an anticipatory smack, his back stiffened, and his head was raised
      until his chin took on so haughty a tilt that Gonzaga feared his proffered
      hospitality was on the point of suffering a scornful rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I share a flagon?&rdquo; gasped the fellow, as, being the sinner that he
      was and knew himself to be, he might have gasped: &ldquo;Will I go to Heaven?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Will I&mdash;will I&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; He paused, and pursed his lips. His
      eyebrows were puckered and his expression grew mighty cunning as again he
      took stock of this pretty fellow who offered flagons of wine to
      down-at-heel adventurers like himself. He had all but asked what was to be
      required of him in exchange for this, when suddenly he bethought him&mdash;with
      the knavish philosophy adversity had taught him&mdash;that were he told
      for what it was intended that the wine should bribe him, and did the
      business suit him not, he should, in the confession of it, lose the wine;
      whilst did he but hold his peace until he had drunk, it would be his
      thereafter to please himself about the business when it came to be
      proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He composed his rugged features into the rude semblance of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet young sir,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;sweet, gentle and most illustrious lord,
      I would share a hogshead with such a nobleman as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to take it that you will drink?&rdquo; quoth Gonzaga, who had scarce known
      what to make of the man&rsquo;s last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Body of Bacchus! Yes. I&rsquo;ll drink with you gentile signorino, until your
      purse be empty or the world run dry.&rdquo; And he leered a mixture of mockery
      and satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga, still half uncertain of his ground, called the taverner and bade
      him bring a flagon of his best. While Luciano was about the fetching of
      the wine, constraint sat upon that oddly discordant pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a chill night,&rdquo; commented Gonzaga presently, seating himself
      opposite his swashbuckler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young sir, your wits have lost their edge. The night is warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said,&rdquo; spluttered Gonzaga, who was unused to contradiction from his
      inferiors, and wished now to assert himself, &ldquo;that the night is chill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lied, then,&rdquo; returned the other, with a fresh leer, &ldquo;for, as I
      answered you, the night is warm. Piaghe di Cristo! I am an ill man to
      contradict, my pretty gallant, and if I say the night is warm, warm it
      shall be though there be snow on Mount Vesuvius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The courtier turned pink at that, and but for the arrival of the taverner
      with the wine, it is possible he might have done an unconscionable
      rashness. At sight of the red liquor the fury died out of the ruffler&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long life, a long thirst, a long purse, and a short memory!&rdquo; was his
      toast, into whose cryptic meaning Gonzaga made no attempt to pry. As the
      fellow set down his cup, and with his sleeve removed the moisture from his
      unshorn mouth, &ldquo;May I not learn,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;whose hospitality I have
      the honour of enjoying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you ever of Romeo Gonzaga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of Gonzaga, yes; though of Romeo Gonzaga never. Are you he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noble family yours,&rdquo; returned the swashbuckler, in a tone that implied
      his own to be as good. &ldquo;Let me name myself to you. I am Ercole Fortemani,&rdquo;
       he said, with the proud air of one who announced himself an emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A formidable name,&rdquo; said Gonzaga, in accents of surprise, &ldquo;and it bears a
      noble sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great fellow turned on him in a sudden anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that astonishment?&rdquo; he blazed. &ldquo;I tell you my name is both noble and
      formidable, and you shall find me as formidable as I am noble. Diavolo!
      Seems it incredible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I so?&rdquo; protested Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had been dead by now if you had, Messer Gonzaga. But you thought so,
      and I may take leave to show you how bold a man it needs to think so
      without suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruffled as a turkey-cock, wounded in his pride and in his vanity, Ercole
      hastened to enlighten Gonzaga on his personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learn, sir,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that I am Captain Ercole Fortemani. I held
      that rank in the army of the Pope. I have served the Pisans and the noble
      Baglioni of Perugia with honour and distinction. I have commanded a
      hundred lances of Gianinoni&rsquo;s famous free-company. I have fought with the
      French against the Spaniards, and with the Spaniards against the French,
      and I have served the Borgia, who is plotting against both. I have trailed
      a pike in the emperor&rsquo;s following, and I have held the rank of captain,
      too, in the army of the King of Naples. Now, young sir, you have learned
      something of me, and if my name is not written in letters of fire from one
      end of Italy to the other, it is&mdash;Body of God!&mdash;because the
      hands that hired me to the work garnered the glory of my deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A noble record,&rdquo; said Gonzaga, who had credulously absorbed that
      catalogue of lies, &ldquo;a very noble record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; the other contradicted, for the lust of contradiction that was a
      part of him. &ldquo;A great record, if you will, to commend me to hireling
      service. But you may not call the service of a hireling noble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a matter we will not quarrel over,&rdquo; said Gonzaga soothingly. The
      man&rsquo;s ferocity was terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says that we shall not?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who will baulk me if I have a
      mind to quarrel over it? Answer me!&rdquo; and he half rose from his seat, moved
      by the anger into which he was lashing himself. &ldquo;But patience!&rdquo; he broke
      off, subsiding on a sudden. &ldquo;I take it, it was not out of regard for my
      fine eyes, nor drawn by the elegance of my apparel&rdquo;&mdash;and he raised a
      corner of his tattered cloak&mdash;&ldquo;nor yet because you wish to throw a
      main with me, that you have sought my acquaintance, and called for this
      wine. You require service of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have guessed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prodigious discernment, by the Host!&rdquo; He seemed to incline rather
      tediously to irony. Then his face grew stern, and he lowered his voice
      until it was no more than a growling whisper. &ldquo;Heed me, Messer Gonzaga. If
      the service you require be the slitting of a gullet or some kindred foul
      business, which my seeming neediness leads you to suppose me ripe for, let
      me counsel you, as you value your own skin, to leave the service
      unmentioned, and get you gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In hasty, frantic, fearful protest were Gonzaga&rsquo;s hands outspread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I could not have thought it of you,&rdquo; he
      spluttered, with warmth, much of which was genuine, for it rejoiced him to
      see some scruples still shining in the foul heap of this man&rsquo;s rascally
      existence. A knave whose knavery knew no limits would hardly have suited
      his ends. &ldquo;I do need a service, but it is no dark-corner work. It is a
      considerable enterprise, and one in which, I think, you should prove the
      very man I need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me know more,&rdquo; quoth Ercole grandiloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need first your word that should the undertaking prove unsuited to you,
      or beyond you, you will respect the matter, and keep it secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Body of Satan! No corpse was ever half so dumb as I shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! Can you find me a score of stout fellows to form a bodyguard
      and a garrison, who, in return for good quarters&mdash;perchance for some
      weeks&mdash;and payment at four times the ordinary mercenaries&rsquo; rate, will
      be willing to take some risk, and chance even a brush with the Duke&rsquo;s
      forces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ercole blew out his mottled cheeks until Gonzaga feared that he would
      burst them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s outlawry!&rdquo; he roared, when he had found his voice. &ldquo;Outlawry, or I&rsquo;m
      a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; confessed Gonzaga. &ldquo;It is outlaw matter of a kind. But the
      risk is slender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me no more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ercole emptied his wine-cup at a draught and splashed the dregs on to the
      floor. Then, setting down the empty vessel, he sat steeped in thought
      awhile. Growing impatient:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Gonzaga at last, &ldquo;can you help me? Can you find the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to tell me more of the nature of this service you require, I
      might find a hundred with ease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I have said&mdash;I need but a score.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ercole looked mighty grave, and thoughtfully rubbed his long nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be done,&rdquo; said he, after a pause. &ldquo;But we shall have to look for
      desperate knaves; men who are already under a ban, and to whom it will
      matter little to have another item added to their indebtedness to the law
      should they fall into its talons. How soon shall you require this forlorn
      company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By to-morrow night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; mused Ercole. He was counting on his fingers, and
      appeared to have lapsed into mental calculations. &ldquo;I could get
      half-a-score or a dozen within a couple of hours. But a score&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Again he paused, and again he fell to thinking. At last, more briskly:
      &ldquo;Let us hear what pay you offer me, to thrust myself thus blindfolded into
      this business of yours as leader of the company you require?&rdquo; he asked
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s face fell at that. Then he suddenly stiffened, and put on an
      expression of haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my intent to lead this company myself,&rdquo; he loftily informed the
      ruffler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Body of God!&rdquo; gasped Ercole, upon whose mind intruded a grotesque picture
      of such a company as he would assemble, being led by this mincing
      carpet-knight. Then recollecting himself: &ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
      had best, yourself, enrol it. Felicissima notte!&rdquo; And he waved him a
      farewell across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a poser for Gonzaga. How was he to go about such a business as
      that? It was beyond his powers. Thus much he protested frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now attend to me, young sir,&rdquo; was the other&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;The matter stands
      thus: If I can repair to certain friends of mine with the information that
      an affair is afoot, the particulars of which I may not give them, but in
      which I am to lead them myself, sharing such risk as there may be, I do
      not doubt but that by this time to-morrow I can have a score of them
      enrolled&mdash;such is their confidence in Ercole Fortemani. But if I take
      them to enter a service unknown, under a leader equally unknown, the
      forming of such a company would be a mighty tedious matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an argument to the force of which Gonzaga could not remain
      insensible. After a moment&rsquo;s consideration, he offered Ercole fifty gold
      florins in earnest of good faith and the promise of pay, thereafter, at
      the rate of twenty gold florins a month for as long as he should need his
      services and Ercole, who in all his free-lancing days had never earned the
      tenth of such a sum, was ready to fall upon this most noble gentleman&rsquo;s
      neck, and weep for very joy and brotherly affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter being settled, Gonzaga produced a heavy bag which gave forth a
      jangle mighty pleasant to the ears of Fortemani, and let it drop with a
      chink upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a hundred florins for the equipment of this company. I do not
      wish to have a regiment of out-at-elbow tatterdemalions at my heels.&rdquo; And
      his eye swept in an uncomplimentary manner over Ercole&rsquo;s apparel. &ldquo;See
      that you dress them fittingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done, Magnificent,&rdquo; answered Ercole, with a show of such
      respect as he had not hitherto manifested. &ldquo;And arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them pikes and arquebuses, if you will; but nothing more. The place
      we are bound for is well stocked with armour&mdash;but even that may not
      be required.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May not be required?&rdquo; echoed the more and more astonished swashbuckler.
      Were they to be paid on so lordly a scale, clothed and fed, to induce them
      upon a business that might carry no fighting with it? Surely he had never
      sold himself into a more likely or promising service, and that night he
      dreamt in his sleep that he was become a gentleman&rsquo;s steward, and that at
      his heels marched an endless company of lacqueys in flamboyant liveries.
      On the morrow he awoke to the persuasion that at last, of a truth, was his
      fortune made, and that hereafter there would be no more pike-trailing for
      his war-worn old arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscientiously he set about enrolling the company, for, in his way, this
      Ercole Fortemani was a conscientious man&mdash;boisterous and unruly if
      you will; a rogue, in his way, with scant respect for property; not above
      cogging dice or even filching a purse upon occasion when hard driven by
      necessity&mdash;for all that he was gently born and had held honourable
      employment; a drunkard by long habit, and a swaggering brawler upon the
      merest provocation. But for all that, riotous and dishonest though he
      might be in the general commerce of life, yet to the hand that hired him
      he strove&mdash;not always successfully, perhaps, but, at least, always
      earnestly&mdash;to be loyal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE &ldquo;TRATTA DI CORDE&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Whilst the bustle of preparation went on briskly in Urbino, Gian Maria, on
      his side, was rapidly disposing of affairs in Babbiano, that he might
      return to the nuptials for which he was impatient. But he had chanced upon
      a deeper tangle than he had reckoned with, and more to do than he had
      looked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of his departure from Urbino, he had ridden as far as Cagli,
      and halted at the house of the noble Messer Valdicampo. This had been
      placed at his disposal, and there he proposed to lie the night. They had
      supped&mdash;the Duke, de&rsquo; Alvari, Gismondo Santi, Messér Valdicampo, his
      wife and two daughters, and a couple of friends, potential citizens of
      Cagli, whom he had invited, that they might witness the honour that was
      being done his house. It waxed late, and the torpor that ensues upon the
      generous gratification of appetite was settling upon the company when
      Armstadt&mdash;Gian Maria&rsquo;s Swiss captain&mdash;entered and approached his
      master with the air of a man who is the bearer of news. He halted a pace
      or two from the Duke&rsquo;s high-backed chair, and stood eyeing Gian Maria in
      stupid patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, fool?&rdquo; growled the Duke, turning his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Swiss approached another step. &ldquo;They have brought him, Highness,&rdquo; he
      said in a confidential whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I a wizard that I must read your thoughts?&rdquo; hectored Gian Maria. &ldquo;Who
      has brought whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Armstadt eyed the company in hesitation. Then, stepping close to the Duke,
      he murmured in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men I left behind have brought the fool&mdash;Ser Peppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden brightening of the eye showed that Gian Maria understood. Without
      apology to the board, he turned and whispered back to his captain to have
      the fellow taken to his chamber, there to await him. &ldquo;Let a couple of your
      knaves be in attendance, and do you come too, Martino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Martin bowed, and withdrew, whereupon Gian Maria found grace to crave his
      host&rsquo;s pardon, with the explanation that the man had brought him news he
      had been expecting. Valdicampo, who for the honour of having a Duke sleep
      beneath his roof would have stomached improprieties far more flagrant,
      belittled the matter and dismissed it. And presently Gian Maria rose with
      the announcement that he had far to journey on the morrow, and so, with
      his host&rsquo;s good leave, would be abed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valdicampo, himself, then played the part of chamberlain, and taking up
      one of the large candle branches, he lighted the Duke to his apartments.
      He would have carried his good offices, and his candles, as far as Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s very bed-chamber, but that in the ante-room his Highness, as
      politely as might be, bade him set down the lights and leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke remained standing for a moment, deliberating whether to afford
      knowledge to Alvari and Santi&mdash;who had followed him and stood
      awaiting his commands&mdash;of what he was about to do. In the end he
      decided that he would act alone and upon his sole discretion. So he
      dismissed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had gone and he was quite alone, he clapped his hands together,
      and in answer to that summons the door of his bedroom opened, revealing
      Martin Armstadt on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is there?&rdquo; inquired the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awaiting your Highness,&rdquo; answered the Swiss, and he held the door for
      Gian Maria to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedchamber apportioned the Duke in the Palazzo Valdicampo was a noble
      and lofty room, in the midst of which loomed the great carved bed of
      honour, with its upright pillars and funereal canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the overmantel stood two five-armed sconces with lighted tapers. Yet
      Gian Maria did not seem to deem that there was light enough for such
      purpose as he entertained, for he bade Martin fetch him the candelabra
      that had been left behind. Then he turned his attention to the group
      standing by the window, where the light from the overmantel fell full upon
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This consisted of three men, two being mercenaries of Armstadt&rsquo;s guard, in
      corselet and morion, and the third, who stood captive between, the
      unfortunate Ser Peppe. The fool&rsquo;s face was paler than its wont, whilst the
      usual roguery had passed from his eyes and his mouth, fear having taken
      possession of its room. He met the Duke&rsquo;s cruel glance with one of alarm
      and piteous entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having assured himself that Peppe had no weapons, and that his arms were
      pinioned behind him, Gian Maria bade the two guards withdraw, but hold
      themselves in readiness in the ante-chamber with Armstadt. Then he turned
      to Peppe with a scowl on his low brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not so merry as you were this morning, fool,&rdquo; he scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peppino squirmed a little, but his nature, schooled by the long habit of
      jest, prompted a bold whimsicality in his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circumstances are scarcely as propitious&mdash;to me. Your Highness,
      though, seems in excellent good­humour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria looked at him angrily a moment. He was a slow-witted man, and
      he could devise no ready answer, no such cutting gibe as it would have
      pleasured him to administer. He walked leisurely to the fire-place, and
      leant his elbow on the overmantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your humour led you into saying some things for which I should be
      merciful if I had you whipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, by the same reasoning, charitable if you had me hanged,&rdquo; returned
      the fool dryly, a pale smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You acknowledge it?&rdquo; cried Gian Maria, never seeing the irony
      intended. &ldquo;But I am a very clement prince, fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proverbially clement,&rdquo; the jester protested, but he did not succeed this
      time in excluding the sarcasm from his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria shot him a furious glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mocking me, animal? Keep your venomous tongue in bounds, or I&rsquo;ll
      have you deprived of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peppe&rsquo;s face turned grey at the threat, as well it might&mdash;for what
      should such a one as he do in the world without a tongue?
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing him dumb and stricken, the Duke continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, for all that you deserve a hanging for your insolence, I am willing
      that you should come by no hurt so that you answer truthfully such
      questions as I have for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peppino&rsquo;s grotesque figure was doubled in a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I await your questions, glorious lord,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the Duke hesitated a moment, writhing inwardly
      at the memory of the exact words in which the fool had spoken. &ldquo;You spoke
      this morning of one whom the Lady Valentina had met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fear seemed to increase on the jester&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, in a
      choking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did she meet this knight you spoke of, and in such wondrous words
      of praise described to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the woods at Acquasparta, where the river Metauro is no better than a
      brook. Some two leagues this side of Sant&rsquo; Angelo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sant&rsquo; Angelo!&rdquo; echoed Gian Maria, starting at the very mention of the
      place where the late conspiracy against him had been hatched. &ldquo;And when
      was this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Wednesday before Easter, as Monna Valentina was journeying from
      Santa Sofia to Urbino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No word spake the Duke in answer. He stood still, his head bowed, and his
      thoughts running again on that conspiracy. The mountain fight in which
      Masuccio had been killed had taken place on the Tuesday night, and the
      conviction&mdash;scant though the evidence might be&mdash;grew upon him
      that this man was one of the conspirators who had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came your lady to speak with this man&mdash;was he known to her?&rdquo; he
      inquired at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Highness; but he was wounded, and so aroused her compassion. She
      sought to minister to his hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wounded?&rdquo; cried Gian Maria, in a shout. &ldquo;Now, by God, it is as I
      suspected. I&rsquo;ll swear he got that wound the night before at Sant&rsquo; Angelo.
      What was his name, fool? Tell me that, and you shall go free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For just a second the hunchback seemed to hesitate. He stood in awesome
      fear of Gian Maria, of whose cruelties some ghastly tales were told. But
      in greater fear he stood of the eternal damnation he might earn did he
      break the oath he had plighted not to divulge that knight&rsquo;s identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I would it might be mine to earn my freedom at so
      light a price; yet it is one that ignorance will not let me pay. I do not
      know his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke looked at him searchingly and suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dull though he was by nature, eagerness seemed now to have set a cunning
      edge upon his wits, and suspicion had led him to observe the fool&rsquo;s
      momentary hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what appearance was he? Describe him to me. How was he dressed? What
      was the manner of his face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, Lord Duke, I cannot answer you. I had but the most fleeting
      glimpse of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke&rsquo;s sallow countenance grew very evil-looking, and an ugly smile
      twisted his lip and laid bare his strong white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So fleeting that no memory of him is left you?&rdquo; quoth he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, Highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, you filth,&rdquo; Gian Maria thundered in a towering rage. &ldquo;It was but
      this morning that you said his height was splendid, his countenance noble,
      his manner princely, his speech courtly, and&mdash;I know not what
      besides. Yet now you tell me&mdash;you tell me&mdash;that your glimpse of
      him was so fleeting that you cannot describe him. You know his name,
      rogue, and I will have it from you, or else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, most noble lord, be not incensed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the fool
      began, in fearful protestation. But the Duke interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incensed?&rdquo; he echoed, his eyes dilating in a sort of horror at the
      notion. &ldquo;Do you dare impute to me the mortal sin of choler? I am not
      incensed; there is no anger in me.&rdquo; He crossed himself, as if to exorcise
      the evil mood if it indeed existed, and devotedly bowing his head and
      folding his hands&mdash;&ldquo;Libera me a malo, Domine!&rdquo; he murmured audibly.
      Then, with a greater fierceness than before&mdash;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he demanded,
      &ldquo;will you tell me his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would I could,&rdquo; the terrified hunchback began. But at that the Duke
      turned from him with a shrug of angry impatience, and clapping his hands
      together:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olá! Martino!&rdquo; he called. Instantly the door opened, and the Swiss
      appeared. &ldquo;Bring in your men and your rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain turned on his heel, and simultaneously the fool cast himself
      at Gian Maria&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, your Highness!&rdquo; he wailed. &ldquo;Do not have me hanged. I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not going to hang you,&rdquo; the Duke broke in coldly. &ldquo;Dead you would
      indeed be dumb, and avail us nothing. We want you alive, Messer Peppino&mdash;alive
      and talkative; we find you very reserved for a fool. But we hope to make
      you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On his knees, Peppe raised his wild eyes to Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother of the Afflicted,&rdquo; he prayed, at which the Duke broke into a
      contemptuous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has the Heavenly Mother to do with such filth as you? Make your
      appeals to me. I am the more immediate arbiter of your fate. Tell me the
      name of that man you met in the woods, and all may yet be well with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peppino knelt in silence, a cold sweat gathering on his pale brow, and a
      horrid fear tightening at his heart and throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet greater than this horror they were preparing for him was the
      horror of losing his immortal soul by a breach of the solemn oath he had
      sworn. Gian Maria turned from him, at last, to his bravi, who now entered
      silently and with the air of men who knew the work expected of them.
      Martino mounted the bed, and swung for an instant from the framework of
      the canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will hold, Highness,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria bade him, since that was so, remove the velvet hangings, whilst
      he despatched one of the men to see that the ante-chamber door was closed,
      so that no cry should penetrate to the apartments of the Valdicampo
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few seconds all was ready, and Peppino was rudely lifted from his
      knees and from the prayers he had been pattering to the Virgin to lend him
      strength in this hour of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time, sir fool,&rdquo; quoth the Duke, &ldquo;will you tell us his
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highness, I cannot,&rdquo; answered Peppe, for all that terror was freezing his
      very blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light of satisfaction gleamed now in Gian Maria&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You no longer protest your ignorance, but
      only that you cannot tell me. Up with him, Martino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a last pitiable struggle against the inevitable, the fool broke from
      his guards, and flung himself towards the door. One of the burly Swiss
      caught him by the neck in a grip that made him cry out with pain. Gian
      Maria eyed him with a sinister smile, and Martin proceeded to fasten one
      end of the rope to his pinioned wrists. Then they led him, shivering to
      the great bed. The other end of the cord was passed over one of the bared
      arms of the canopy-frame. This end was grasped by the two men-at-arms.
      Martin stood beside the prisoner. The Duke flung himself into a great
      carved chair, an air of relish now investing his round, pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what is about to befall you,&rdquo; he said, in tones of chilling
      indifference. &ldquo;Will you speak before we begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the fool, in a voice that terror was throttling, &ldquo;you are
      a good Christian, a loyal son of Mother Church, and a believer in the
      eternal fires of hell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A frown settled on Gian Maria&rsquo;s brow. Was the fool about to intimidate him
      with talk of supernatural vengeance?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; Peppe continued, &ldquo;you will perhaps be merciful when I confess my
      position. I made most solemn oath to the man I met at Acquasparta on that
      luckless day, that I would never reveal his identity. What am I to do? If
      I keep my oath, you will torture me to death perhaps. If I break it, I
      shall be damned eternally. Have mercy, noble lord, since now you know how
      I am placed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile broadened on Gian Maria&rsquo;s face, and the cruelty of his mouth and
      eyes seemed intensified by it. The fool had told him that which he would
      have given much to learn. He had told him that this man whose name he
      sought, had so feared that his presence that day at Acquasparta should
      become known, that he had bound the fool by oath not to divulge the secret
      of it. Of what he had before suspected he was now assured. The man in
      question was one of the conspirators; probably the very chief of them.
      Nothing short of the fool&rsquo;s death under torture would now restrain him
      from learning the name of that unknown who had done him the double injury
      of conspiring against him, and&mdash;if the fool were to be believed&mdash;of
      capturing the heart of Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the damnation of your soul I shall not be called to answer,&rdquo; he said
      at last. &ldquo;Care enough have I to save my own&mdash;for temptations are many
      and this poor flesh is weak. But it is this man&rsquo;s name I need, and&mdash;by
      the five wounds of Lucia of Viterbo!&mdash;I will have it. Will you
      speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something like a sob shook the poor fool&rsquo;s deformed frame. But that was
      all. With bowed head he preserved a stubborn silence. The Duke made a sign
      to the men, and instantly the two of them threw their weight upon the
      rope, hoisting Peppe by his wrists until he was at the height of the
      canopy itself. That done, they paused, and turned their eyes upon the Duke
      for further orders. Again Gian Maria called upon the fool to answer his
      questions; but Peppe, a writhing, misshapen mass from which two wriggling
      legs depended, maintained a stubborn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; snarled Gian Maria, out of patience. The men released the
      rope, and allowed some three feet of it to run through their hands. Then
      they grasped it again, so that Peppe&rsquo;s sudden fall was as suddenly
      arrested by a jerk that almost wrenched his arms from their sockets. A
      shriek broke from him at that exquisite torture, and he was dragged once
      more to the full height of the canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you speak now?&rdquo; asked Gian Maria coldly, amusedly almost. But still
      the fool was silent, his nether lip caught so tightly in his teeth that
      the blood trickled from it adown his chin. Again the Duke gave the signal,
      and again they let him go. This time they allowed him a longer drop, so
      that the wrench with which they arrested it was more severe than had been
      the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peppe felt his bones starting from their joints, and it was as if a
      burning iron were searing him at shoulder, elbow and wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful God!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Oh, have pity, noble lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the noble lord had him hoisted anew to the canopy. Writhing there in
      the extremity of his anguish, the poor hunchback poured forth from
      frothing lips a stream of curses and imprecations, invoking Heaven and
      hell to strike his tormentors dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke, from whose demeanour it might be inferred that he was inured
      to the effect produced by this form of torture, looked on with a cruel
      smile, as of one who watches the progress of events towards the end that
      he desires and has planned. He was less patient, and his signal came more
      quickly now. For a third time the fool was dropped, and drawn up, now, a
      short three feet from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he did not so much as scream. He hung there, dangling at the
      rope&rsquo;s end, his mouth all bloody, his face ghastly in its glistening
      pallor, and of his eyes naught showing save the whites. He hung there, and
      moaned piteously and incessantly. Martin glanced questioningly at Gian
      Maria, and his eyes very plainly inquired whether they had not better
      cease. But Gian Maria paid no heed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will that suffice you?&rdquo; he asked the fool. &ldquo;Will you speak now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the fool&rsquo;s only answer was a moan, whereupon again, at the Duke&rsquo;s
      relentless signal, he was swung aloft. But at the terror of a fourth drop,
      more fearful than any of its three predecessors, he awoke very suddenly to
      the impossible horror of his position. That this agony would endure until
      he died or fainted, he was assured. And since he seemed incapable of
      either fainting or dying, suffer more he could not. What was heaven or
      hell to him then that the thought of either could efface the horror of
      this torture and strengthen him to continue to endure the agony of it? He
      could endure no more&mdash;no, not to save a dozen souls if he had had
      them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak,&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Let me down, and you shall have his name, Lord
      Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pronounce it first, or the manner of your descent shall be as the
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peppe passed his tongue over his bleeding lips, hung still and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was your cousin,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;Francesco del Falco, Count of Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke stared at him a moment, with startled countenance and mouth
      agape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are telling me the truth, animal?&rdquo; he demanded, in a quivering voice.
      &ldquo;It was the Count of Aquila who was wounded and whom Monna Valentina
      tended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; answered the fool. &ldquo;Now, in the name of God and His blessed
      saints, let me down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment yet he was held there, awaiting Gian Maria&rsquo;s signal. The Duke
      continued to eye him with that same astonished look, what time he turned
      over in his mind the news he had gathered. Then conviction of the truth
      sank into his mind. It was the Lord of Aquila who was the idol of the
      Babbianians. What, then, more natural than that the conspirators should
      have sought to place him on the throne they proposed to wrest from Gian
      Maria? He dubbed himself a fool that he had not guessed so much before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him down,&rdquo; he curtly bade his men. &ldquo;Then take him hence, and let him
      go with God. He has served his purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gently they lowered him, but when his feet touched the ground he was
      unable to stand. His legs doubled under him, and he lay&mdash;a little
      crook-backed heap&mdash;upon the rushes of the floor. His senses had
      deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Armstadt the two men picked him up and carried him out
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria moved across the room to a tapestried prie­dieu, and knelt down
      before an ivory crucifix to render thanks to God for the signal light of
      grace, by which He had vouchsafed to show the Duke his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter, drawing from the breast of his doublet a chaplet of gold and
      amber beads, he piously discharged his nightly devotions.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE BRAYING OF AN ASS
    </h2>
    <p>
      When on the morrow, towards the twenty-second hour, the High and Mighty
      Gian Maria Sforza rode into his capital at Babbiano, he found the city in
      violent turmoil, occasioned, as he rightly guessed, by the ominous
      presence of Caesar Borgia&rsquo;s envoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dense and sullen crowd met him at the Porta Romana, and preserved a
      profound silence as he rode into the city, accompanied by Alvari and
      Santi, and surrounded by his escort of twenty spears in full armour. There
      was a threat in that silence more ominous than any vociferations, and very
      white was the Duke&rsquo;s face as he darted scowls of impotent anger this way
      and that. But there was worse to come. As they rode up the Borgo dell&rsquo; 
      Annunziata the crowd thickened, and the silence was now replaced by a
      storm of hooting and angry cries. The people became menacing, and by
      Armstadt&rsquo;s orders&mdash;the Duke was by now too paralysed with fear to
      issue any&mdash;the men-at-arms lowered their pikes in order to open a
      way, whilst one or two of the populace, who were thrust too near the
      cavalcade by the surging human tide, went down and were trampled under
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satirical voices asked the Duke derisively was he wed, and where might be
      his uncle-in-law&rsquo;s spears that were to protect them against the Borgia.
      Some demanded to know whither the last outrageous levy of taxes was gone,
      and where was the army it should have served to raise. To this, others
      replied for the Duke, suggesting a score of vile uses to which the money
      had been put.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of a sudden, a cry of &ldquo;Murderer!&rdquo; arose, followed by angry demands
      that he should restore life to the valiant Ferrabraccio, to Amerini, the
      people&rsquo;s friend, and to those others whom he had lately butchered, or else
      follow them in death. Lastly the name of the Count of Aquila rang wildly
      in his ears, provoking a storm of &ldquo;Evviva! Live Francesco del Falco!&rdquo; and
      one persistent voice, sounding loudly above the others, styled him already
      &ldquo;il Duca Francesco.&rdquo; At that the blood mounted to Gian Maria&rsquo;s brain, and
      a wave of anger beat back the fear from his heart. He rose in his
      stirrups, his eyes ablaze with the jealous wrath that possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ser Martino!&rdquo; he roared hoarsely to his captain. &ldquo;Couch lances and go
      through them at the gallop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The burly Swiss hesitated, brave man though he was. Alvaro de&rsquo; Alvari and
      Gismondo Santi looked at each other in alarm, and the intrepid old
      statesman, in whose heart no pang of fear had been awakened by the
      rabble&rsquo;s threatening bay, changed colour as he heard that order given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highness,&rdquo; he implored the Duke, &ldquo;You cannot mean this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mean it?&rdquo; flashed back Gian Maria, his eye travelling from Santi to
      the hesitating captain. &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he blazed at the latter. &ldquo;Brute beast, for
      what do you wait? Did you not hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a second&rsquo;s delay the captain now raised his sword, and his deep,
      guttural voice barked an order to his men which brought their lances below
      the horizontal. The mob, too, had heard that fierce command, and awakening
      to their peril, those nearest the cavalcade would have fallen back but
      that the others, pressing tightly from behind, held them in the death-tide
      that now swept by with clattering arms and hoarse cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrieks filled the air where lately threats had been loudly tossed. But
      some there were in that crowd that would be no passive witnesses of this
      butchery. Half the stones of the borgo went after that cavalcade, and fell
      in a persistent shower upon them, rattling like giant hail upon their
      armour, dinting many a steel-cap to its wearer&rsquo;s sore discomfort. The Duke
      himself was struck twice, and on Santi&rsquo;s unprotected scalp an ugly wound
      was opened from which the blood flowed in profusion to dye his snowy
      locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this undignified manner they reached, at last, the Palazzo Ducale,
      leaving a trail of dead and maimed to mark the way by which they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a white heat of passion Gian Maria sought his apartments, and came not
      forth again until, some two hours later, the presence was announced him of
      the emissary from Caesar Borgia, Duke of Valentinois, who sought an
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still beside himself, and boiling with wrath at the indignities he had
      received, Gian Maria&mdash;in no mood for an interview that would have
      demanded coolness and presence of mind from a keener brain than his&mdash;received
      the envoy, a gloomy, priestly-faced Spaniard, in the throne-room of the
      Palace. The Duke was attended by Alvari, Santi, and Fabrizio da Lodi,
      whilst his mother, Caterina Colonna, occupied a chair of crimson velvet on
      which the Sforza lion was wrought in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview was brief, and marked by a rudeness at its close that
      contrasted sharply with the ceremoniousness of its inception. It soon
      became clear that the ambassador&rsquo;s true mission was to pick a quarrel with
      Babbiano on his master&rsquo;s behalf, to the end that the Borgia might be
      afforded a sound pretext for invading the Duchy. He demanded, at first
      politely and calmly, and later&mdash;when denied&mdash;with arrogant
      insistance, that Gian Maria should provide the Duke of Valentinois with a
      hundred lances&mdash;equivalent to five hundred men&mdash;as some
      contribution on his part towards the stand which Caesar Borgia meant to
      make against the impending French invasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria never heeded the restraining words which Lodi whispered in his
      ear, urging him to temporise, and to put off this messenger until the
      alliance with the house of Urbino should be complete and their position
      strengthened sufficiently to permit them to brave the anger of Caesar
      Borgia. But neither this nor the wrathful, meaning glances which his
      cunning mother bent upon him served to curb him. He obeyed only the voice
      of his headstrong mood, never dreaming of the consequences with which he
      might be visited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will bear to the Duca Valentino this message from me,&rdquo; he said, in
      conclusion. &ldquo;You will tell him that what lances I have in Babbiano I
      intend to keep, that with them I may defend my own frontiers against his
      briganding advances. Messer da Lodi,&rdquo; he added, turning to Fabrizio and
      without so much as waiting to see if the envoy had anything further to
      say, &ldquo;let this gentleman be reconducted to his quarters, and see that he
      has safe conduct hence until he is out of our Duchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the envoy, crimson of face and threatening of eye, had withdrawn
      under Lodi&rsquo;s escort, Monna Caterina rose, the very incarnation of outraged
      patience, and poured her bitter invective upon her rash son&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she stormed at him. &ldquo;There goes your Duchy&mdash;in the hollow of
      that man&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; Then she laughed in bitterness. &ldquo;After all, in casting
      it from you, perhaps you have chosen the wiser course, for, as truly as
      there is a God in Heaven, you are utterly unfitted to retain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lady mother,&rdquo; he answered her, with such dignity as he could muster
      from the wretched heap in which his wits now seemed to lie, &ldquo;you will be
      well advised to devote yourself to your woman&rsquo;s tasks, and not to
      interfere in a man&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s work!&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;And you perform it like a petulant boy or a
      peevish woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perform it, Madonna, as best seems to me, for it happens that I am Duke
      of Babbiano,&rdquo; he answered sullenly. &ldquo;I do not fear any Pope&rsquo;s son that
      ever stepped. The alliance with Urbino is all but completed. Let that be
      established, and if Valentino shows his teeth&mdash;by God we&rsquo;ll show
      ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, but with this difference, that his are a wolf&rsquo;s teeth, and yours a
      lamb&rsquo;s. Besides, this alliance with Urbino is all incomplete as yet. You
      had been better advised to have sent away the envoy with some indefinite
      promise that would have afforded you respite enough in which to seal
      matters with the house of Montefeltro. As it is, your days are numbered.
      Upon that message you have sent him Caesar will act at once. For my own
      part, I have no mind to fall a prey to the invader, and I shall leave
      Babbiano, and seek refuge in Naples. And if a last word of advice I may
      offer you, it is that you do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria rose and came down from the dais, eyeing her in a sort of dull
      amazement. Then he looked, as if for help, to Alvari, to Santi, and lastly
      to Lodi, who had returned while Caterina was speaking. But no word said
      any of them, and grave were the eyes of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor-spirited are you all!&rdquo; he sneered. Then his face grew dark and his
      tone concentrated. &ldquo;Not so am I,&rdquo; he assured them, &ldquo;if in the past I may
      have seemed it sometimes. I am aroused at length, sirs. I heard a voice in
      the streets of Babbiano to-day, and I saw a sight that has put a fire into
      my veins. This good-tempered, soft, indulgent Duke you knew is gone. The
      lion is awake at last, and you shall see such things as you had not dreamt
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They regarded him now with eyes in which the gravity was increased by a
      light of fearsome wonder and inquiry. Was his mind giving way under the
      prodigious strain that had been set upon it that day? If not madness, what
      else did that wild boasting argue?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all dumb?&rdquo; he asked them, his eyes feverish. &ldquo;Or do you deem that
      I promise more than is mine to fulfil. You shall judge, and soon.
      To-morrow, my lady mother, whilst you journey south, as you have told us,
      I go north again, back to Urbino. Not a day will I now waste. Within the
      week, sirs, by God&rsquo;s grace, I shall be wed. That will give us Urbino for a
      buckler, and with Urbino comes Perugia and Camerino. But more than that.
      There is a princely dowry comes to us with the Lady Valentina. How think
      you will I spend it? To the last florin it shall go to the arming of men.
      I will hire me every free condotta in Italy. I will raise me such an army
      as has never before been seen at any one time, and with this I shall seek
      out the Duca Valentino. I&rsquo;ll not sit here at home awaiting the pleasure of
      his coming, but I&rsquo;ll out to meet him, and with that army I shall descend
      upon him as a thunderbolt out of Heaven. Aye, my lady mother,&rdquo; he laughed
      in his madness, &ldquo;the lamb shall hunt the wolf, and rend it so that it
      shall never stand again to prey on other lambs. This will I do, my
      friends, and there shall be such fighting as has not been seen since the
      long-dead days of Castracani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stared at him, scarce believing now that he was sane, and marvelling
      deeply whence had sprung this sudden martial fervour in one whose nature
      was more indolent than active, more timid than warlike. And yet the reason
      was not far to seek, had they but cared to follow the line of thought to
      which he, himself, had given them the clue when he referred to the voice
      he had heard, and the sights he had seen in the streets of Babbiano. The
      voice was the voice that had acclaimed his cousin Francesco Duke. That it
      was through that a fierce jealousy had fired him. This man had robbed him
      at once of the love of his people and of Valentina, and thereby had set in
      his heart the burning desire to outdo him and to prove wrong in their
      preference both his people and Valentina. He was like a gamer who risks
      all on a single throw, and his stake was to be the dowry of his bride, the
      game a tilt with the forces of the Borgia. If he won he came out covered
      with glory, and not only the saviour of his people and the champion of
      their liberty, but a glorious figure that all Italy&mdash;or, at least,
      that part of it that had known the iron heel of Valentino&mdash;should
      revere. Thus would he set himself right, and thus crush from their minds
      the memory of his rebellious cousin with whom he was about to deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother turned to him now, and her words were words of caution, prayers
      that he should adventure on naught so vast and appalling to her woman&rsquo;s
      mind, without due thought and argument in council. A servant entered at
      that moment, and approached the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; Gian Maria announced, breaking in upon her earnest words, &ldquo;I am
      fully resolved upon my course. If you will but delay a moment and resume
      your seat, you shall witness the first scene of this great drama that I am
      preparing.&rdquo; Then turning to the waiting servant: &ldquo;Your message?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Armstadt has returned, Highness, and has brought his Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch lights and then admit them,&rdquo; he commanded briefly. &ldquo;To your places,
      sirs, and you, my mother. I am about to sit in judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazed and uncomprehending, they obeyed his wild gestures, and resumed
      their places by the throne even as he walked back to the dais and sat
      himself upon the ducal chair. Servants entered, bearing great candelabra
      of beaten gold which they set on table and overmantel. They withdrew, and
      when the doors opened again, a clank of mail, reaching them from without,
      increased the astonishment of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rose yet higher, and left them cold and speechless, when into the
      chamber stepped the Count of Aquila with a man-at-arms on either side of
      him, marking him a prisoner. With a swift, comprehensive glance that took
      in the entire group about the throne&mdash;and without manifesting the
      slightest surprise at Lodi&rsquo;s presence&mdash;Francesco stood still and
      awaited his cousin&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was elegantly dressed, but without lavishness, and if he had the air of
      a great lord, it was rather derived from the distinction of his face and
      carriage. He was without arms, and bareheaded save for the gold coif he
      always wore, which seemed to accentuate the lustrous blackness of his
      hair. His face was impassive, and the glance as that of a man rather weary
      of the entertainment provided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an oppressive silence of some moments, during which his cousin
      regarded him with an eye that glittered oddly. At last Gian Maria broke
      into speech, his voice shrill with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you of any reason,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;why your head should not be
      flaunted on a spear among those others on the Gate of San Bacolo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up in justifiable astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of many,&rdquo; he answered, with a smile, an answer which by its
      simplicity seemed to nonplus the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hear some of them,&rdquo; he challenged presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, let us hear, rather, some reason why my poor head should be so
      harshly dealt with. When a man is rudely taken, as I have been, it is a
      custom, which perhaps your Highness will follow, to afford him some reason
      for the outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You smooth-tongued traitor,&rdquo; quoth the Duke, with infinite malice, made
      angrier by his cousin&rsquo;s dignity. &ldquo;You choicely-spoken villain! You would
      learn why you have been taken? Tell me, sir, what did you at Acquasparta
      on the morning of the Wednesday before Easter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count&rsquo;s impassive face remained inscrutable, a mask of patient wonder.
      By the sudden clenching of his hands alone did he betray how that thrust
      had smitten him, and his hands none there remarked. Fabrizio da Lodi,
      standing behind the Duke, went pale to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not recall that I did anything there of much account,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;I breathed the good spring air in the woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing else?&rdquo; sneered Gian Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can bethink me of little else that signifies. I met a lady there with
      whom I had some talk, a friar, a fool, a popinjay, and some soldiers.
      But,&rdquo;&mdash;he shifted abruptly, his tone growing haughty&mdash;&ldquo;whatever
      I did, I did as best seemed to me, and I have yet to learn that the Count
      of Aquila must give account of what he does and where he does it. You have
      not told me yet, sir, by what right, or fancied right, you hold me
      prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not, indeed? See you no link between your offence and your
      presence near Sant&rsquo; Angelo on that day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am to apprehend that you have had me brought here with this
      indignity to set me riddles for your amusement, I am enlightened and yet
      amazed. I am no court buffoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words, words,&rdquo; snapped the Duke. &ldquo;Do not think to beguile me with them.&rdquo;
       With a short laugh he turned from Francesco to those upon the dais. &ldquo;You
      will be marvelling, sirs, and you, my lady mother, upon what grounds I
      have had this traitor seized. You shall learn. On the night of the Tuesday
      before Easter seven traitors met at Sant&rsquo; Angelo to plot my overthrow. Of
      those, the heads of four may be seen on the walls of Babbiano now; the
      other three made off, but there stands one of them&mdash;the one that was
      to have occupied this throne after they had unseated me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of all were now upon the young Count, whilst his own glance
      strayed to the face of Lodi, on which there was written a consternation so
      great that it must have betrayed him had the Duke but chanced to look his
      way. A pause ensued which none present dared to break. Gian Maria seemed
      to await an answer from Francesco; but Francesco stood impassively
      regarding him, and made no sign that he would speak. At length, unable
      longer to endure the silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;E dunque?&rdquo; cried the Duke. &ldquo;Have you no answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would submit,&rdquo; returned Francesco, &ldquo;that I have heard no question. I
      heard a wild statement, extravagant and mad, the accusation of one
      demented, a charge of which no proofs can be forthcoming, else I take it
      you had not withheld them. I ask you, sirs, and you, Madonna,&rdquo; he
      continued, turning to the others, &ldquo;has his Highness said anything to which
      an answer can by any means be necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it proofs you lack?&rdquo; cried Gian Maria, but less confidently than
      hitherto, and, so, less fiercely. A doubt had arisen in his mind born of
      this strange calm on the part of Francesco&mdash;a calm that to Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s perceptions seemed hardly the garb of guilt, but belonged rather
      to one who is assured that no peril threatens him. &ldquo;Is it proofs you
      lack?&rdquo; quoth the Duke again, and then with the air of a man launching an
      unanswerable question: &ldquo;How came you by the wound you had that day in the
      woods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile quivered on Francesco&rsquo;s face, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked for proofs, not questions,&rdquo; he protested wearily. &ldquo;What shall it
      prove if I had a hundred wounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove?&rdquo; echoed the Duke, less and less confident of his ground, fearing
      already that he had perhaps gone too fast and too far upon the road of his
      suspicions. &ldquo;It proves to me, when coupled with your presence there, that
      you were in the fight the night before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco stirred at that. He sighed and smiled at once. Then assuming a
      tone of brisk command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid these men begone,&rdquo; he said, pointing to his guards. &ldquo;Then hear me
      scatter your foul suspicions as the hurricane scatters the leaves in
      autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria stared at him in stupefaction. That overwhelming assurance,
      that lofty, dignified bearing which made such a noble contrast with his
      own coarse hectoring, were gradually undermining more and more his
      confidence. With a wave of his hand he motioned the soldiers to withdraw,
      obeying almost unconsciously the master-mind of his cousin by which he was
      as unconsciously being swayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Highness,&rdquo; said Francesco, as soon as the men were gone, &ldquo;before I
      refute the charge you make, let me clearly understand it. From the
      expressions you have used I gather it to be this: A conspiracy was laid a
      little time ago at Sant&rsquo; Angelo which had for object to supplant you on
      the throne of Babbiano and set me in your place. You charge me with having
      had in that conspiracy a part&mdash;the part assigned to me. It is so, is
      it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have put it very clearly,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;If you can make out your
      innocence as clearly, I shall be satisfied that I have wronged you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That this conspiracy took place we will accept as proven, although to the
      people of Babbiano the proof may have seemed scant. A man, since dead, had
      told your Highness that such a plot was being hatched. Hardly, perhaps, in
      itself, evidence enough to warrant setting the heads of four very valiant
      gentlemen on spears, but no doubt your Highness had other proofs to which
      the rest of us had no access.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria shivered at the words. He recalled what Francesco had said on
      the occasion of their last talk upon this very subject; he remembered the
      manner of his own reception that day in Babbiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be content that it is so,&rdquo; calmly pursued Francesco. &ldquo;Indeed,
      your Highness&rsquo;s action in the matter leaves no doubt. We will accept,
      then, that such a plot was laid, but that I had a part in it, that I was
      the man chosen to take your place&mdash;need I prove the idleness of such
      a charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need, in truth. By God! you need, if you would save your head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count stood in an easy posture, his hands clasped behind his back, and
      smiled up at his cousin&rsquo;s pale face and scowling brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How mysterious are the ways of your justice, Cousin,&rdquo; he murmured, with
      infinite relish; &ldquo;what a wondrous equity invests your methods! You have me
      dragged here by force, and sitting there, you say to me: &lsquo;Prove that you
      have not conspired against me, or the headsman shall have you!&rsquo; By my
      faith! Soloman was a foolish prattler when compared with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria smote the gilded arm of his chair a blow for which he was to
      find his hand blackened on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it!&rdquo; he screamed, like a child in a pet. &ldquo;Prove it, prove it, prove
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have my words not already proven it?&rdquo; quoth the Count, in a voice of
      such mild wonder and gentle protest that it left Gian Maria gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Duke made a hasty gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Alvari,&rdquo; he said, in a voice of concentrated rage, &ldquo;I think you
      had best recall the guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; the Count compelled him, raising his hand. And now it was seen
      that the easy insouciance was gone from his face: the smile had vanished,
      and in its place there was a look of lofty and contemptuous wrath. &ldquo;I will
      repeat my words. You have dragged me here before you by force, and,
      sitting there on the throne of Babbiano, you say: &lsquo;Prove that you have not
      conspired against me if you would save your head.&rsquo;&rdquo; A second he paused,
      and noted the puzzled look with which all regarded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a parable?&rdquo; sneered the uncomprehending Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it,&rdquo; flashed back Francesco. &ldquo;A parable it is. And if you
      consider it, does it not afford you proof enough?&rdquo; he asked, a note of
      triumph in his voice. &ldquo;Do not our relative positions irrefutably show the
      baselessness of this your charge? Should I stand here and you sit there if
      what you allege against me were true?&rdquo; He laughed almost savagely, and his
      eyes flashed scornfully upon the Duke. &ldquo;If more plainly still you need it,
      Gian Maria, I tell you that had I plotted to occupy your tottering throne,
      I should be on it now, not standing here defending myself against a
      foolish charge. But can you doubt it? Did you learn no lesson as you rode
      into Babbiano to-day? Did you not hear them acclaim me and groan at you.
      And yet,&rdquo; he ended, with a lofty pity, &ldquo;you tell me that I plotted. Why,
      if I desired your throne, my only need would be to unfurl my banner in the
      streets of your capital, and within the hour Gian Maria would be Duke no
      more. Have I proved my innocence, Highness?&rdquo; he ended quietly, sadly
      almost. &ldquo;Are you convinced how little is my need for plots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke had no answer for him. Speechless, and in a sort of dazed
      horror, he sat and scowled before him at his cousin&rsquo;s handsome face, what
      time the others watched him furtively, in silence, trembling for the young
      man who, here, in his grasp, had dared say such things to him. Presently
      he covered his face with his hands, and sat so, as one deeply in thought,
      a little while. At last he withdrew them slowly and presented a
      countenance that passion and chagrin had strangely ravaged in so little
      time. He turned to Santi, who stood nearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The guard,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, with a wave of the hand, and Santi went,
      none daring to utter a word. They waited thus an odd group, all very grave
      save one, and he the one that had most cause for gravity. Then the captain
      re-entered, followed by his two men, and Gian Maria waved a hand towards
      the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away,&rdquo; he muttered harshly, his face ghastly, and passion
      shaking him like an aspen. &ldquo;Take him away, and await my orders in the
      ante-chamber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is farewell, Cousin,&rdquo; said Francesco, &ldquo;may I hope that you will
      send a priest to me? I have lived a faithful Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria returned him no answer, but his baleful eye was upon Martino.
      Reading the significance of that glance, the captain touched Francesco
      lightly on the arm. A moment the Count stood, looking from the Duke to the
      soldiers; a second his glance rested on those assembled there; then, with
      a light raising of his shoulders, he turned on his heel, and with his head
      high passed out of the ducal chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      And silence continued after he was gone until Caterina Colonna broke it
      with a laugh that grated on Gian Maria&rsquo;s now very tender nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised bravely,&rdquo; she mocked him, &ldquo;to play the lion. But so far, we
      have only heard the braying of an ass.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. WANDERING KNIGHTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      That taunt of his mother&rsquo;s stirred Gian Maria. He rose from his ducal
      chair and descended from the dais on which it stood, possessed by a
      tempestuous mood that would not brook him to sit still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The braying of an ass?&rdquo; he muttered, facing Caterina. Then he laughed
      unpleasantly. &ldquo;The jaw-bone of an ass did sore execution on one occasion,
      Madonna, and it may again. A little patience, and you shall see.&rdquo; Next,
      and with a brisker air, he addressed the four silent courtiers, &ldquo;You heard
      him, sirs,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;How do you say that I shall deal with such a
      traitor?&rdquo; He waited some seconds for an answer, and it seemed to anger him
      that none came. &ldquo;Have you, then, no counsel for me?&rdquo; he demanded harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought,&rdquo; said Lodi hardily, &ldquo;that this was a case in which
      your Highness needed counsel. You were drawn to conclude that the Lord of
      Aquila was a traitor, but from what we have all heard, your Highness
      should now see that he is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I so?&rdquo; the Duke returned, standing still and fixing upon Fabrizio
      an eye that was dull as a snake&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Messer da Lodi, your loyalty is a
      thing that has given signs of wavering of late. Now, if by the grace of
      God and His blessed saints I have ruled as a merciful prince who errs too
      much upon the side of clemency, I would enjoin you not to try that
      clemency too far. I am but a man, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned from the fearless front presented by the old statesman, to face
      the troubled glances of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your silence, sirs, tells me that in this matter your judgement runs
      parallel with mine. And you are wise, for in such a case there can be but
      one course. My cousin has uttered words to-day which no man has ever said
      to a prince and lived. Nor shall we make exception to that rule. My Lord
      of Aquila&rsquo;s head must pay the price of his temerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; cried Caterina, in a voice of horror. Gian Maria faced her in a
      passion, his countenance grown mottled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said it,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I will not sleep until he dies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet never may you wake again,&rdquo; she answered. And with that preamble she
      launched upon his head the bitterest criticism he had ever heard. By
      stinging epithets and contemptuous words, she sought to make him see the
      folly of what he meditated. Was he indeed tired of ruling Babbiano? If
      that were so, she told him, he had but to wait for Caesar Borgia&rsquo;s coming.
      He need not precipitate matters by a deed that must lead to a revolt, a
      rising of the people to avenge their idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have given me but added reasons,&rdquo; he answered her stoutly. &ldquo;There is
      no room in my Duchy for a man whose death, if it pleased me to encompass
      it, would be avenged upon me by my own people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then send him from your dominions,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Banish him, and all may
      be well. But if you slay him, I should not count your life worth a day&rsquo;s
      purchase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This advice was sound, and in the end they prevailed upon him to adopt it.
      But it was not done save at the cost of endless prayers on the part of
      those courtiers, and the persuasions of Caterina&rsquo;s biting scorn and
      prophecies of the fate that surely awaited him did he touch the life of
      one so well­beloved. At last, against his will, he sullenly consented that
      the banishment of his cousin should content him. But it was with infinite
      bitterness and regret that he passed his word, for his jealousy was of a
      quality that nothing short of Francesco&rsquo;s death could have appeased.
      Certain it is that nothing but the fear of the consequences, which his
      mother had instilled into his heart, could have swayed him to be satisfied
      that the Count of Aquila should be banished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent for Martino and bade him return the Count his sword, and he
      entrusted the message of exile to Fabrizio da Lodi, charging him to
      apprise Francesco that he was allowed twenty-four hours&rsquo; grace in which to
      take himself beyond the dominions of Gian Maria Sforza.
    </p>
    <p>
      That done&mdash;and with an exceedingly ill grace&mdash;the Duke turned on
      his heel, and with a sullen brow he left the ducal chamber, and passed,
      unattended, to his own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejoicing, Fabrizio da Lodi went his errand, which he discharged with
      certain additions that might have cost him his head had knowledge of them
      come to Gian Maria. In fact, he seized the opportunity to again press upon
      Francesco the throne of Babbiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hour is very ripe,&rdquo; he urged the Count, &ldquo;and the people love you as
      surely prince was never loved. It is in their interests that I plead. You
      are their only hope. Will you not come to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If for a moment Francesco hesitated, it was rather in consideration of the
      manner in which the crown was offered than in consequence of any
      allurement that the offer may have had for him. Once&mdash;that night at
      Sant&rsquo; Angelo&mdash;he had known temptation, and for a moment had listened
      to the seductions in the voice that invited him to power. But not so now.
      A thought he gave to the people who had such faith in him, and showered
      upon him such admiring love, and whom, as a matter of reciprocity, he
      wished well, and would have served in any capacity but this. He shook his
      head, and with a smile of regret declined the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have patience, old friend,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I am not of the stuff that goes to
      make good princes, although you think it. It is a bondage into which I
      would not sell myself. A man&rsquo;s life for me, Fabrizio&mdash;a free life
      that is not directed by councillors and at the mercy of the rabble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fabrizio&rsquo;s face grew sad. He sighed profoundly, yet since it might not be
      well for him that he should remain over-long in talk with one who, in the
      Duke&rsquo;s eyes, was attainted with treason, he had not leisure to insist with
      persuasions, which, after all, he clearly saw must in the end prove
      barren.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the salvation of the people of Babbiano,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;was also
      your Excellency&rsquo;s, since did you adopt the course I urge there would be no
      need to go in banishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this exile suits me excellently well,&rdquo; returned Francesco. &ldquo;Idle
      have I been over-long, and the wish to roam is in my veins again. I&rsquo;ll see
      the world once more, and when I weary of my vagrancy I can withdraw to my
      lands of Aquila, and in that corner of Tuscany, too mean to draw a
      conqueror&rsquo;s eye, none will molest me, and I shall rest. Babbiano, my
      friend, shall know me no more after to-night. When I am gone, and the
      people realise that they may not have what they would, they may rest
      content perhaps with what they may.&rdquo; And he waved a hand in the direction
      of the doors leading to the ducal chamber. With that he took his leave of
      his old friend, and, carrying in his hand the sword and dagger which
      Captain Armstadt had returned to him, he repaired briskly to the northern
      wing of the Palace, in which he had his lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ante-room he dismissed those of his servants who had been taken
      from the ranks of the Duke&rsquo;s people, and bade his own Tuscan followers,
      Zaccaria and Lanciotto, see to the packing of his effects, and make all
      ready to set out within the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was no coward, but he had no wish to die just yet if it might be
      honourably avoided. Life had some sweets to offer Francesco del Falco, and
      this spurred him to hasten, for he well knew his cousin&rsquo;s unscrupulous
      ways. He was aware that Gian Maria had been forced by weight of argument
      to let him go, and he shrewdly feared that did he linger, his cousin might
      veer round again, and without pausing to seek advice a second time, have
      him disposed of out of hand and reckless of consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Lanciotto was left busy in the ante-room the Count passed into his
      bedchamber attended by Zaccaria, to make in his raiment such changes as
      were expedient. But scarce had he begun when he was interrupted by the
      arrival of Fanfulla degli Arcipreti, whom Lanciotto ushered in.
      Francesco&rsquo;s face lighted at sight of his friend, and he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that has happened?&rdquo; cried the young gallant, adding that which
      showed his question to be unnecessary, for from Fabrizio da Lodi he had
      had the whole story of what was befallen. He sat himself upon the bed, and
      utterly disregarding the presence of Zaccaria&mdash;whom he knew to be
      faithful&mdash;he attempted to persuade the Count where Fabrizio had
      failed. But Paolo cut him short ere he had gone very far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have done with that,&rdquo; he said, and for all that he said it with a laugh,
      determination sounded sturdy in his accents. &ldquo;I am a knight-errant, not a
      prince, and I&rsquo;ll not be converted from one to the other. It were making a
      helot of a free man, and you do not love me, Fanfulla, if you drive this
      argument further. Do you think me sad, cast down, at the prospect of this
      banishment? Why, boy, the blood runs swifter through my veins since I
      heard the sentence. It frees me from Babbiano in an hour when perhaps my
      duty&mdash;the reciprocation of the people&rsquo;s love&mdash;might otherwise
      have held me here, and it gives me liberty to go forth, my good Fanfulla,
      in quest of such adventure as I choose to follow.&rdquo; He threw out his arms,
      and displayed his splendid teeth in a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanfulla eyed him, infected by the boisterous gladness of his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, true indeed, my lord,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;you are too fine a bird to
      sing in a cage. But to go knight-erranting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, and
      spread his hands in protest. &ldquo;There are no longer dragons holding
      princesses captive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas no. But the Venetians are on the eve of war, and they will find work
      for these hands of mine. I want not for friends among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanfulla sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so we lose you. The stoutest arm in Babbiano leaves us in the hour of
      need, driven out by that loutish Duke. By my soul, Ser Francesco, I would
      I might go with you. Here is nothing to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco paused in the act of drawing on a boot, and raised his eyes to
      stare a moment at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you wish it, Fanfulla, I shall rejoice to have your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the idea of it entered Fanfulla&rsquo;s mind in earnest, for his
      expression had been more or less an idle one. But since Francesco invited
      him, why not indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it came to pass that at the third hour of that warm May night a
      party of four men on horseback and two sumpter mules passed out of
      Babbiano and took the road that leads to Vinamare, and thence into the
      territory of Urbino. These riders were the Count of Aquila and Fanfulla
      degli Arcipreti, followed by Lanciotto leading a mule that bore the arms
      of those knights-errant, and Zaccaria leading another with their general
      baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night they rode beneath the stars, and on until some three hours after
      sunrise, when they made halt in a hollow of the hills not far from
      Fabriano. They tethered their horses in a grove of peaceful laurel and
      sheltering mulberry, at the foot of a slope that was set with olive trees,
      grey, gnarled and bent as aged cripples, and beside the river Esino at a
      spot where it was so narrow that an agile man might leap its width. Here,
      then, they spread their cloaks, and Zaccaria unpacked his victuals, and
      set before them a simple meal of bread and wine and roasted fowl, which to
      their hunger made more appeal than a banquet at another season. And when
      they had eaten they laid them down beside the stream, and there beguiled
      in pleasant talk the time until they fell asleep. They rested them through
      the heat of the day, and waking some three hours after noon, the Count
      rose up and went some dozen paces down the stream to a spot where it fell
      into a tiny lake&mdash;a pool deep and blue as the cloudless heavens which
      it mirrored. Here he stripped off his garments and plunged headlong in, to
      emerge again, some moments later, refreshed and reinvigorated in body and
      in soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Fanfulla awoke he beheld an apparition coming towards him, a figure
      lithe and stalwart as a sylvian god, the water shining on the ivory
      whiteness of his skin and glistening in his sable hair as the sunlight
      caught it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me now, Fanfulla, lives there a man of so depraved a mind that he
      would prefer a ducal crown to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the courtier, seeing Francesco&rsquo;s radiant mien, understood perhaps, at
      last, how sordid was the ambition that could lure a man from such a
      god-like freedom, and from the holy all-consuming joys it brought him. His
      thoughts being started upon that course, it was of this they talked what
      time the Count resumed his garments&mdash;his hose of red, his knee-high
      boots of untanned leather, and his quilted brigandine of plain brown
      cloth, reputed dagger-proof. He rose at last to buckle on his belt of
      hammered steel, from which there hung, behind his loins, a stout, lengthy
      dagger, the only weapon that he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his command the horses were saddled and the sumpters laden once more.
      Lanciotto held his stirrup, and Zaccaria did like service for Fanfulla,
      and presently they were cantering out of that fragrant grove on to the
      elastic sward of broad, green pasture-lands. They crossed the stream at a
      spot where the widened sheet of water scarce went higher than their
      horses&rsquo; hocks; then veering to the east they rode away from the hills for
      a half-league or so until they gained a road. Here they turned northward
      again, and pushed on towards Cagli.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the bells were ringing the Ave Maria the cavalcade drew up before the
      Palazzo Valdicampo, where two nights ago Gian Maria had been entertained.
      Its gates were now as readily thrown wide to welcome the illustrious and
      glorious Count of Aquila, who was esteemed by Messer Valdicampo no less
      than his more puissant cousin. Chambers were set at his disposal, and at
      Fanfulla&rsquo;s; servants were bidden to wait upon them; fresh raiment was laid
      out for them, and a noble supper was prepared to do honour to Francesco.
      Nor did the generous Valdicampo&rsquo;s manner cool when he learned that
      Francesco was in disgrace at the Court of Babbiano and banished from the
      dominions of Duke Gian Maria. He expressed sympathetic regret at so
      untoward a circumstance and discreetly refrained from passing any opinion
      thereupon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet later, as they supped, and when perhaps the choice wines had somewhat
      relaxed his discretion, he permitted himself to speak of Gian Maria&rsquo;s ways
      in terms that were very far from laudatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, in my house,&rdquo; he informed them, &ldquo;he committed an outrage upon a
      poor unfortunate, for which an account may yet be asked of me&mdash;since
      it was under my roof that the thing befell, for all that I knew nothing of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon being pressed by Paolo to tell them more, he parted with the
      information that the unfortunate in question was Urbino&rsquo;s jester Peppe. At
      that, Paolo&rsquo;s glance became more intent. The memory of his meeting with
      the fool and his mistress in the woods, a month ago, flashed now across
      his mind, and it came to him that he could rightly guess the source whence
      his cousin had drawn the information that had led to his own arrest and
      banishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what nature was the outrage?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what Peppe himself has told me it would seem that the fool was
      possessed of some knowledge which Gian Maria sought, but on which Peppe
      was bound by oath to silence. Gian Maria caused him to be secretly taken
      and carried off from Urbino. His sbirri brought the fellow here, and to
      make him speak the Duke improvised in his bedchamber a tratta di corde,
      which had the desired result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count&rsquo;s face grew dark with anger. &ldquo;The coward!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The
      dastardly craven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But bethink you, sir Count,&rdquo; exclaimed Valdicampo, &ldquo;that this poor Peppe
      is a frail and deformed creature, lacking the strength of an ordinary man,
      and do not judge him over-harshly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not of him I spoke,&rdquo; replied Francesco, &ldquo;but of my cousin, that
      cowardly tyrant, Gian Maria Sforza. Tell me, Messer Valdicampo&mdash;what
      has become of Ser Peppe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still here. I have had him tended, and his condition is already
      much improved. It will not be long ere he is recovered, but for a few days
      yet his arms will remain almost useless. They were all but torn from his
      body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the meal was done Francesco begged his host to conduct him to Peppe&rsquo;s
      chamber. This Valdicampo did, and leaving Fanfulla in the company of the
      ladies of his house, he escorted the Count to the room where the poor,
      ill-used hunchback was abed tended by one of the women of Valdicampo&rsquo;s
      household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a visitor to see you, Ser Peppe,&rdquo; the old gentleman announced,
      setting down his candle on a table by the bed. The jester turned his great
      head towards the newcomer&rsquo;s, and sought with melancoly eyes the face of
      his visitor. At sight of him a look of terror spread itself upon his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he cried, struggling into a sitting posture, &ldquo;my noble,
      gracious lord, have mercy on me. I could tear out this craven tongue of
      mine. But did you know what agonies I suffered, and to what a torture they
      submitted me to render me unfaithful, it may be that you, yourself, would
      pity me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that I do,&rdquo; answered Francesco gently. &ldquo;Indeed, could I have seen
      the consequences that oath would have for you, I had not bound you by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fear in Peppe&rsquo;s face gave place to unbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you forgive me, lord?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I dreaded when you entered that you
      were come to punish me for what wrong I may have done you in speaking. But
      if you forgive me, it may be that Heaven will forgive me also, and that I
      may not be damned. And that were a thousand pities, for what, my lord,
      should I do in hell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deride the agonies of Gian Maria,&rdquo; answered Francesco, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were almost worth burning for,&rdquo; mused Peppe, putting forth a hand,
      whose lacerated, swollen wrist bore evidence to the torture he had
      suffered. At sight of it the Count made an exclamation of angry horror,
      and hastened to inquire into the poor fool&rsquo;s condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so bad now,&rdquo; Peppe answered him, &ldquo;and it is only in consequence
      of Messer Valdicampo&rsquo;s insistence that I have kept my bed. I can scarce
      use my arms, it is true, but they are improving. To-morrow I shall be up,
      and I hope to set out for Urbino, where my dear mistress must be
      distressed with fears for my absence, for she is a very kind and
      tender­hearted lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This resolve of Peppe&rsquo;s prompted the Count to offer to conduct him to
      Urbino on the morrow, since he, himself, would be journeying that way&mdash;an
      offer which the fool accepted without hesitation and with lively
      gratitude.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE FOOL&rsquo;S INQUISITIVENESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning Francesco set out once more, accompanied by his servants,
      Fanfulla, and the fool. The latter was now so far restored as to be able
      to sit a mule, but lest the riding should over-tire him they proceeded at
      little more than an ambling pace along the lovely valleys of the Metauro.
      Thus it befell that when night descended it found them still journeying,
      and some two leagues distant from Urbino. Another league they travelled in
      the moonlight, and the fool was beguiling the time for them with a droll
      story culled from the bright pages of Messer Boccaccio, when of a sudden
      his sharp ears caught a sound that struck him dumb in the middle of a
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you faint?&rdquo; asked Francesco, turning quickly towards him, and mindful
      of the fellow&rsquo;s sore condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered the fool, with a readiness that dispelled the Count&rsquo;s
      alarm on that score. &ldquo;I thought I heard a sound of marching in the
      distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind in the trees, Peppino,&rdquo; explained Fanfulla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short and listened and now they
      all heard it, for it came wafted to them on a gust of the fitful breeze
      that smote their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Francesco. &ldquo;It is the tramp of men. But what of
      that, Peppe? Men will march in Italy. Let us hear the end of your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who should march in Urbino, and by night?&rdquo; the fool persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know or do I care?&rdquo; quoth the Count. &ldquo;Your story, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all that he was far from satisfied, the fool resumed his narrative.
      But he no longer told it with his former irresistible humour. His mind was
      occupied with that sound of marching, which came steadily nearer. At
      length he could endure it no longer, and the apathy of his companions
      fired him openly to rebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he cried, turning to the Count, and again leaving his story
      interrupted, &ldquo;they are all but upon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; agreed Francesco indifferently. &ldquo;The next turn yonder should bring
      us into them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I beg you, Lord Count, to step aside. Let us pause here, under the
      trees, until they have passed. I am full of fears. Perhaps I am a coward,
      but I mislike these roving night-hands. It may be a company of
      masnadieri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; returned the Count, without slackening speed. &ldquo;What cause
      have we to fear a party of robbers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fanfulla and the servants joined their advice to Peppe&rsquo;s, and
      prevailed at last upon Francesco to take cover until this company should
      have passed. He consented, to pacify them, and wheeling to the right they
      entered the border of the forest, drawing rein well in the shadow, whence
      they could survey the road and see who passed across the patch of
      moonlight that illumined it. And presently the company came along and
      swung into that revealing flood of light. To the astonishment of the
      watchers they beheld no marauding party such as they had been led to
      expect, but a very orderly company of some twenty men, soberly arrayed in
      leather hacketons and salades of bright steel, marching sword on thigh and
      pike on shoulder. At the head of this company rode a powerfully-built man
      on a great sorrel horse, at sight of whom the fool swore softly in
      astonishment. In the middle of the party came four litters borne by mules,
      and at the side of one of them rode a slender, graceful figure that
      provoked from Peppe a second oath. But the profoundest objurgation of all
      was wrung from him at sight of a portly bulk in the black habit of the
      Dominicans ambling in the rear, who just then was in angry altercation
      with a fellow that was urging his mule along with the butt of his
      partisan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May you be roasted on a gridiron like Saint Lawrence,&rdquo; gasped the irate
      priest. &ldquo;Would you break my neck, brute beast that you are? Do you but
      wait until we reach Roccaleone, and by St. Dominic, I&rsquo;ll get your
      ruffianly commander to hang you for this ill-seasoned jest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his tormentor laughed for answer, and smote the mule again, a blow
      this time that almost caused it to rear up. The friar cried out in angry
      alarm, and then, still storming and threatening his persecutor, he passed
      on. After him came six heavily-laden carts, each drawn by a pair of
      bullocks, and the rear of the procession was brought up by a flock of a
      dozen bleating sheep, herded by a blasphemant man-at-arms. They passed the
      astonished watchers, who remained concealed until that odd company had
      melted away into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could swear,&rdquo; said Fanfulla, &ldquo;that that friar and I have met before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor would you do a perjury,&rdquo; answered him the fool. &ldquo;For it is that fat
      hog Fra Domenico&mdash;he that went with you to the Convent of Acquasparta
      to fetch unguents for his Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he in that company, and who are they?&rdquo; asked the Count, turning
      to the fool as they rode out of their ambush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask me where the devil keeps his lures,&rdquo; quoth the fool, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make
      some shift to answer you. But as for what does Fra Domenico in that
      galley, it is more than I can hazard a guess on. He is not the only one
      known to me,&rdquo; Peppino added, &ldquo;There was Ercole Fortemani, a great, dirty,
      blustering ruffian whom I never saw in aught but rags, riding at their
      heads in garments of most unwonted wholeness; and there was Romeo Gonzaga,
      whom I never knew to stir by night save to an assignation. Strange things
      must be happening in Urbino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the litters?&rdquo; inquired Francesco, &ldquo;Can you hazard no guess as to
      their meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;saving that they may account for the presence of Messer
      Gonzaga. For litters argue women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems, fool, that not even your wisdom shall avail us. But you heard
      the friar say they were bound for Roccaleone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard that. And by means of it we shall probably learn the rest at
      the end of our journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And being a man of extremely inquisitive mind, the fool set his inquiries
      on foot the moment they entered the gates of Urbino in the morning&mdash;for
      they had reached the city over-late to gain admittance that same night,
      and were forced to seek shelter in one of the houses by the river. It was
      of the Captain of the Gate that he sought information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, Ser Capitan,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;what company was that that
      travelled yesternight to Roccaleone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked at him a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was none that I know of,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Certainly none from Urbino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You keep a marvellous watch,&rdquo; said the fool drily. &ldquo;I tell you that a
      company of men-at-arms some twenty strong went last night from Urbino to
      Roccaleone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Roccaleone?&rdquo; echoed the captain, with a musing air, more attentively
      than before, as if the repetition of that name had suggested something to
      his mind. &ldquo;Why, it is the castle of Monna Valentina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, sapient sir. But what of the company, and why was it travelling so,
      by night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How know you it proceeded from Urbino?&rdquo; quoth the captain earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because at its head I recognised the roaring warrior Ercole Fortemani, in
      the middle rode Romeo Gonzaga, in the rear came Fra Domenico, Madonna&rsquo;s
      confessor&mdash;men of Urbino all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer&rsquo;s face grew purple at the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there any women in the party?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw none,&rdquo; replied the fool, in whom this sudden eagerness of the
      captain&rsquo;s awakened caution and reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there were four litters,&rdquo; put in Francesco, whose nature was less
      suspicious and alert than the wise fool&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late Peppe scowled caution at him. The captain swore a great oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is she,&rdquo; he cried, with assurance. &ldquo;And this company was travelling to
      Roccaleone, you say. How know you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We heard it from the friar,&rdquo; answered Francesco readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by the Virgin! we have them. Olá!&rdquo; He turned from them, and ran
      shouting into the gatehouse, to re-emerge a moment later with half-dozen
      soldiers at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Palace,&rdquo; he commanded, and as his men surrounded Francesco&rsquo;s
      party, &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he said to the Count. &ldquo;You must go with us, and tell
      your story to the Duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need for all this force,&rdquo; answered Francesco coldly. &ldquo;In any
      case, I could not pass through Urbino without seeing Duke Guidobaldo. I am
      the Count of Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once the captain&rsquo;s bearing grew respectful. He made his apologies for
      the violent measures of his zeal, and bade his men fall behind. Ordering
      them to follow him, he mounted a horse that was brought him, and rode
      briskly through the borgo at the Count&rsquo;s side. And as he rode he told them
      what the jester&rsquo;s quick intuition had already whispered to him. The lady
      Valentina was fled from Urbino in the night, and in her company were gone
      three of her ladies, and&mdash;it was also supposed, since they had
      disappeared&mdash;Fra Domenico and Romeo Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aghast at what he heard, Francesco pressed his informer for more news; but
      there was little more that the captain could tell him, beyond the fact
      that it was believed she had been driven to it to escape her impending
      marriage with the Duke of Babbiano. Guidobaldo was distraught at what had
      happened, and anxious to bring the lady back before news of her behaviour
      should reach the ears of Gian Maria. It was, therefore, a matter of no
      little satisfaction to the captain that the task should be his to bear
      Guidobaldo this news of her whereabouts which from Francesco and the
      jester he had derived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peppe looked glum and sullen. Had he but bridled his cursed curiosity, and
      had the Count but taken the alarm in time and held his peace, all might
      have been well with his beloved patrona. As it was, he&mdash;the one man
      ready to die that he might serve her&mdash;had been the very one to betray
      her refuge. He heard the Count&rsquo;s laugh, and the sound of it was fuel to
      his anger. But Francesco only thought of the splendid daring of the lady&rsquo;s
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But these men-at-arms that she had with her?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;For what purpose
      so numerous a bodyguard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked at him a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not guess?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Perhaps you do not know the Castle of
      Roccaleone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were odd if I did not know the most impregnable fortress in Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, does it not become clear? She has taken this company for a
      garrison, and in Roccaleone she clearly intends to resist in rebel fashion
      the wishes of his Highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that the Count threw back his head, and scared the passers-by with as
      hearty a peal of laughter as ever crossed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Host!&rdquo; he gasped, laughter still choking his utterance. &ldquo;There is
      a maid for you! Do you hear what the captain says, Fanfulla? She means to
      resist this wedding by armed force if needs be. Now, on my soul, if
      Guidobaldo insists upon the union after this, why, then, he has no heart,
      no feeling. As I live, she is a kinswoman that such a warlike prince might
      well be proud of. Small wonder that they do not fear the Borgia in
      Urbino.&rdquo; And he laughed again. But the captain scowled at him, and Peppe
      frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a rebellious jade,&rdquo; quoth the captain sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, softly,&rdquo; returned Francesco; for all that he still laughed. &ldquo;If you
      were of knightly rank I&rsquo;d break a lance with you on that score. As it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       he paused, his laughter ceased, and his dark eyes took the captain&rsquo;s
      measure in a curious way. &ldquo;Best leave her uncensured, Ser Capitano. She is
      of the house of Rovere, and closely allied to that of Montefeltro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer felt the rebuke, and silence reigned between them after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was whilst Francesco, Fanfulla and Peppe waited in the ante-chamber for
      admittance to the Duke that the jester vented some of the bitterness he
      felt at their babbling. The splendid room was thronged with a courtly
      crowd. There were magnificent nobles and envoys, dark ecclesiastics and
      purple prelates, captains in steel and court officers in silk and velvet.
      Yet, heedless of who might hear him, Peppe voiced his rebuke, and the
      terms he employed were neither as measured nor as respectful as the
      Count&rsquo;s rank dictated. Yet with that fairness of mind that made him so
      universally beloved, Francesco offered no resentment to the fool&rsquo;s
      reproof. He saw that it was deserved, for it threw upon the matter a light
      that was new and more searching. But he presently saw further than did the
      fool, and he smiled at the other&rsquo;s scowls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud Peppe,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You over-estimate the harm. At worst, we
      have but anticipated by a little what the Duke must have learnt from other
      sources.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is just that little&mdash;the few hours or days&mdash;that will do
      the mischief,&rdquo; snapped the jester testily, for all that he lowered his
      voice. &ldquo;In a few days Gian Maria will be back. If he were met with the
      news that the Lady Valentina were missing, that she had run away with
      Romeo Gonzaga&mdash;for that, you&rsquo;ll see, will presently be the tale&mdash;do
      you think he would linger here, or further care to pursue his wooing? Not
      he. These alliances that are for State purposes alone, in which the heart
      plays no part, demand, at least, that on the lady&rsquo;s side there shall be a
      record unblemished by the breath of scandal. His Highness would have
      returned him home, and Madonna would have been rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But at a strange price, Peppe,&rdquo; answered Franeesco gravely. &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I agree that I would have served her purpose better by keeping
      silent. But that such an affair will cool the ardour of my cousin I do not
      think. You are wrong in placing this among the alliances in which the
      heart has no part. On my cousin&rsquo;s side&mdash;if all they say be true&mdash;the
      heart plays a very considerable part indeed. But, for the rest&mdash;what
      harm have we done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; said the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will show, then, that I have done no hurt whatever to her interests.
      By now she is safe in Roccaleone. What, then, can befall her? Guidobaldo,
      no doubt, will repair to her, and across the moat he will entreat her to
      be a dutiful niece and to return. She will offer to do so on condition
      that he pass her his princely word not to further molest her with the
      matter of this marriage. And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; growled the fool, &ldquo;And then? Who shall say what may befall then?
      Let us say that his Highness reduces her by force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A siege?&rdquo; laughed the Count. &ldquo;Pooh! Where is your wisdom, fool! Do you
      think the splendid Guidobaldo is eager to become the sport of Italy, and
      go down to posterity as the duke who besieged his niece because she
      resisted his ordainings touching the matter of her wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guidobaldo da Montefeltro can be a violent man upon occasion,&rdquo; the fool
      was answering, when the officer who had left them reappeared with the
      announcement that his Highness awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the Prince in a very gloomy mood, and after greeting Francesco
      with cool ceremony, he questioned him on the matter of the company they
      had met yesternight. These inquiries he conducted with characteristic
      dignity, and no more show of concern than if it had been an affair of a
      strayed falcon. He thanked Francesco for his information, and gave orders
      that the seneschal should place apartments at his and Fanfulla&rsquo;s disposal
      for as long as it should please them to grace his court. With that he
      dismissed them, bidding the officer remain to receive his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Francesco to Peppe, as they crossed the ante-chamber in
      the wake of a servant, &ldquo;is the man who would lay siege to his niece&rsquo;s
      castle? For once, sir fool, your wisdom is at fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know the Duke, Excellency,&rdquo; answered the fool. &ldquo;Beneath that
      frozen exterior burns a furnace, and there is no madness he would not
      commit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Francesco only laughed as, linking arms with Fanfulla, he passed down
      the gallery on his way to the apartments to which the servant was
      conducting them.

      CHAPTER XIII. GIAN MARIA MAKES A VOW
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a measure the events that followed would almost tend to show that the
      fool was right. For even if the notion of besieging Valentina and reducing
      her by force of arms was not Guidobaldo&rsquo;s own in the first place, yet he
      lent a very willing ear to the counsel that they should thus proceed, when
      angrily urged two days thereafter by the Duke of Babbiano.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon hearing the news Gian Maria had abandoned himself to such a licence
      of rage as made those about him tremble from the highest to the meanest.
      The disappointment of his passion was in itself justification enough for
      this; but, in addition, Gian Maria beheld in the flight of Valentina the
      frustration of those bold schemes of which had talked so loudly to his
      councillors and his mother. It was his confidence in those same schemes
      that had induced him to send that defiant answer to Caesar Borgia. As a
      consequence of this there was haste&mdash;most desperate haste&mdash;that
      he should wed, since wedding was to lend him the power to carry out his
      brave promises of protecting his crown from the Duke of Valentinois, not
      to speak of the utter routing of the Borgia which he had wildly undertaken
      to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the destinies of States should be tossed to the winds of Heaven by a
      slip of a girl was to him something as insufferable as it had been
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be brought back!&rdquo; he had screeched, in his towering passion.
      &ldquo;She must be brought back at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; answered Guidobaldo, in his serene way; &ldquo;she must be brought back.
      So far, I agree with you entirely. Tell me, now, how the thing is to be
      accomplished.&rdquo; And there was sarcasm in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difficulties does it present?&rdquo; inquired Gian Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No difficulties,&rdquo; was the ironical reply. &ldquo;She has shut herself up in the
      stoutest castle in Italy, and tells me that she will not come forth until
      I promise her freedom of choice in the matter of marriage. Clearly, there
      are no difficulties attached to her being brought back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria showed his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you give me leave to go about it in my own way?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only do I give you leave, but I&rsquo;ll render you all the assistance in
      my power, if you can devise a means for luring her from Roccaleone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hesitate no longer. Your niece, Lord Duke, is a rebel, and as a rebel
      is she to be treated. She has garrisoned a castle, and hurled defiance at
      the ruler of the land. It is a declaration of war, Highness, and war we
      shall have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would resort to force?&rdquo; asked Guidobaldo, disapproval lurking in his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the force of arms, your Highness,&rdquo; answered Gian Maria, with prompt
      fierceness. &ldquo;I will lay siege to this castle of hers, and I shall tear it
      stone from stone. Oh, I would have wooed her nicely had she let me, with
      gentle words and mincing ways that maidens love. But since she defies us,
      I&rsquo;ll woo her with arquebuse and cannon, and seek by starvation to make her
      surrender to my suit. My love shall put on armour to subject her, and I
      vow to God that I shall not shave my beard until I am inside her castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should counsel gentler measures,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Besiege her if you will,
      but do not resort to too much violence. Cut off their resources and let
      hunger be your advocate. Even so, I fear me, you will be laughed at by all
      Italy,&rdquo; he added bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fig for that! Let the fools laugh if they be minded to. What forces has
      she at Roccaleone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the question Guidobaldo&rsquo;s brow grew dark. It was as if he had recalled
      some circumstance that had lain forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some twenty knaves led by a notorious ruffian of the name of Fortemani.
      The company was enrolled, they tell me, by a gentleman of my court, a
      kinsman of my Duchess, Messer Romeo Gonzaga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he with her now?&rdquo; gasped Gian Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Virgin&rsquo;s Ring of Perugia!&rdquo; spluttered Gian Maria in increased
      dismay. &ldquo;Do you suggest that they fled together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord!&rdquo; Guidobaldo&rsquo;s voice rang sharp and threatening. &ldquo;It is of my
      niece that you are speaking. She took this gentleman with her just as she
      took three of her ladies and a page or two, to form such attendance as
      befits her birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gian Maria took a turn in the apartment, a frown wrinkling his brow, and
      his lips pressed tight. Guidobaldo&rsquo;s proud words by no means convinced
      him. But the one preponderating desire in his heart just then was to
      humble the girl who had dared to flout him, to make her bend her stubborn
      neck. At last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may indeed become the laughing-stock of Italy,&rdquo; he muttered, in a
      concentrated voice, &ldquo;but I shall carry my resolve through, and my first
      act upon entering Roccaleone will be to hang this knave Gonzaga from its
      highest turret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That very day Gian Maria began his preparations for the expedition against
      Roccaleone, and word of it was carried by Fanfulla to Francesco&mdash;for
      the latter had left his quarters at the palace upon hearing of Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s coming, and was now lodging at the sign of the &ldquo;Sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon hearing the news he swore a mighty oath in which he consigned his
      cousin to the devil, by whom, in that moment, he pronounced him begotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; he asked, when he was calmer, &ldquo;that this man Gonzaga is
      her lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than I can say,&rdquo; answered Fanfulla. &ldquo;There is the fact that
      she fled with him. Though when I questioned Peppe on this same subject he
      first laughed the notion to scorn, and then grew grave. &lsquo;She loves him
      not, the popinjay,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but he loves her, or I am blind else, and
      he&rsquo;s a villain, I know.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco stood up, his face mighty serious, and his dark eyes full of
      uneasy thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Host! It is a shameful thing,&rdquo; he cried out at last. &ldquo;This poor
      lady so beset on every hand by a parcel of villains, each more
      unscrupulous than the other. Fanfulla, send for Peppe. We must despatch
      the fool to her with warning of Gian Maria&rsquo;s coming, and warning, too,
      against this man of Mantua she has fled with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late,&rdquo; answered Fanfulla. &ldquo;The fool departed this morning for
      Roccaleone, to join his patrona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco looked his dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be undone,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Thus between the upper and the nether
      stone&mdash;between Gian Maria and Romeo Gonzaga. Gesù! she will be
      undone! And she so brave and so high-spirited!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved slowly to the casement, and stood staring at the windows across
      the street, on which the setting sun fell in a ruddy glow. But it was not
      the windows that he saw. It was a scene in the woods at Acquasparta on
      that morning after the mountain fight; a man lying wounded in the bracken,
      and over him a gentle lady bending with eyes of pity and solicitude. Often
      since had his thoughts revisited that scene, sometimes with a smile,
      sometimes with a sigh, and sometimes with both at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned suddenly upon Fanfulla. &ldquo;I will go myself,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; echoed Fanfulla. &ldquo;But the Venetians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a gesture the Count signified how little the Venetians weighed with him
      when compared with the fortunes of this lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Roccaleone,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;now&mdash;at once.&rdquo; And striding
      to the door he beat his hands together and called Lanciotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, Fanfulla, that in these days there are no longer maidens held
      in bondage to whom a knight-errant may lend aid. You were at fault, for in
      Monna Valentina we have the captive maiden, in my cousin the dragon, in
      Gonzaga another, and in me the errant knight who is destined&mdash;I hope&mdash;to
      save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will save her from Gian Maria?&rdquo; questioned Fanfulla incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will attempt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his servant, who entered as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We set out in a quarter of an hour, Lanciotto,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Saddle for me
      and for yourself. You are to go with me. Zaccaria may remain with Messer
      degli Arcipreti. You will care for him, Fanfulla, and he will serve you
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of me?&rdquo; cried Fanfulla. &ldquo;Do I not accompany you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will, yes. But you might serve me better by returning to Babbiano
      and watching the events there, sending me word of what befalls&mdash;for
      great things will befall soon if my cousin returns not and the Borgia
      advances. It is upon this that I am founding such hopes as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whither shall I send you word? To Roccaleone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco reflected a moment. &ldquo;If you do not hear from me, then send your
      news to Roccaleone, for if I should linger there and we are besieged, it
      will perhaps be impossible to send a message to you. But if&mdash;as I
      hope&mdash;I go to Aquila, I will send you word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Aquila?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It may be that I shall be at Aquila before the week is out. But keep
      it secret, Fanfulla, and I&rsquo;ll fool these dukes to the very top of their
      unhealthy bent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later the Count of Aquila, mounted on a stout Calabrian horse,
      and attended by Lanciotto on a mule, rode gently down towards the valley.
      They went unnoticed, for what cared for them the peasants that sang at
      their labours in the contado?
    </p>
    <p>
      They met a merchant, whose servant was urging his laden sumpters up the
      hilly road to the city on the heights, and they passed him with a
      courteous greeting. Farther they came upon a mounted company of nobles and
      ladies, returning from a hawking party, and followed by attendants bearing
      their hooded falcons, and their gay laughter still rang in Francesco&rsquo;s
      ears after he had passed from their sight and vanished in the purple mists
      of eventide that came up to meet him from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned westward towards the Apennines, and pushed on after night had
      fallen, until the fourth hour, when at Francesco&rsquo;s suggestion they drew
      rein before a sleepy, wayside locanda, and awoke the host to demand
      shelter. There they slept no longer than until matins, so that the grey
      light of dawn saw them once more upon their way, and by the time the sun
      had struck with its first golden shaft the grey crest of the old hills,
      they drew rein on the brink of the roaring torrent at the foot of the
      mighty crag that was crowned by the Castle of Roccaleone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grim and gaunt it loomed above the fertile vale, with that torrent
      circling it in a natural moat, like a giant sentinel of the Apennines that
      were its background. And now the sunlight raced down the slopes of the old
      mountains like a tide. It smote the square tower of the keep, then flowed
      adown the wall, setting the old grey stone a-gleaming, and flashing back
      from a mullioned window placed high up. Lower it came, revealing grotesque
      gargoyles, flooding the crenellated battlements and turning green the ivy
      and lichen that but a moment back had blackened the stout, projecting
      buttresses. Thence it leapt to the ground, and drove the shadow before it
      down the grassy slope, until it reached the stream and sparkled on its
      foaming, tumbling waters, scattering a hundred colours through the flying
      spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that time, until the sun had reached him and included him in the
      picture it was awakening, the Count of Aquila sat in his saddle, with
      thoughtful eyes uplifted to the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, Lanciotto following him, he walked his horse round the western side,
      where the torrent was replaced by a smooth arm of water, for which a
      cutting had been made to complete the isolation of the crag of Roccaleone.
      But here, where the castle might more easily have become vulnerable, a
      blank wall greeted him, broken by no more than a narrow slit or two midway
      below the battlements. He rode on towards the northern side, crossing a
      footbridge that spanned the river, and at last coming to a halt before the
      entrance tower. Here again the moat was formed by the torrential waters of
      the mountain stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bade his servant rouse the inmates, and Lanciotto hallooed in a voice
      that nature had made deep and powerful. The echo of it went booming up to
      scare the birds on the hillside, but evoked no answer from the silent
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They keep a zealous watch,&rdquo; laughed the Count. &ldquo;Again, Lanciotto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man obeyed him, and again and again his deep voice rang out like a
      trumpet-call before sign was made from within that it had been heard. At
      length, above the parapet of the tower appeared a stunted figure with head
      unkempt, as grotesque almost as any of the gargoyles beneath, and an
      owlish face peered at them from one of the crenels of the battlement, and
      demanded, in surly, croaking tones their business. Instantly the Count
      recognised Peppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morrow, fool,&rdquo; he bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my lord?&rdquo; exclaimed the jester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sleep soundly at Roccaleone,&rdquo; quoth Francesco. &ldquo;Bestir that knavish
      garrison of yours, and bid the lazy dogs let down the bridge. I have news
      for Monna Valentina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once, Excellency,&rdquo; the fool replied, and would have gone upon the
      instant but that Francesco recalled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Peppe, a knight&mdash;the knight she met at Acquasparta, if you
      will. But leave my name unspoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the assurance that he would obey his wishes Peppe went his errand. A
      slight delay ensued, and then upon the battlements appeared Gonzaga,
      sleepy and contentious, attended by a couple of Fortemani&rsquo;s knaves, who
      came to ask the nature of Francesco&rsquo;s business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is with Monna Valentina,&rdquo; answered him Francesco, raising head and
      voice, so that Gonzaga recognised him for the wounded knight of
      Acquasparta, remembered and scowled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Monna Valentina&rsquo;s captain here,&rdquo; he announced, with arrogance. &ldquo;And
      you may deliver to me such messages as you bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a contention, conducted ill-humouredly on the part of
      Gonzaga and scarcely less so on the Count&rsquo;s, Francesco stoutly refusing to
      communicate his business to any but Valentina, and Gonzaga as stoutly
      refusing to disturb the lady at that hour, or to lower the bridge. Words
      flew between them across the waters of the moat, and grew hotter at each
      fresh exchange, till in the end they were abruptly terminated by the
      appearance of Valentina herself, attended by Peppino.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this, Gonzaga?&rdquo; she inquired, her manner excited, for the fool
      had told her that it was the knight Francesco who sought admittance, and
      at the very mention of the name she had flushed, then paled, then started
      for the ramparts. &ldquo;Why is this knight denied admittance since he bears a
      message for me?&rdquo; And from where she stood she sought with admiring eyes
      the graceful shape of the Count of Aquila&mdash;the knight-errant of her
      dreams. Francesco bared his head, and bent to the withers of his horse in
      courteous greeting. She turned to Gonzaga impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what do you wait?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Have you not understood my wishes? Let
      the bridge be lowered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, Madonna,&rdquo; he remonstrated. &ldquo;You do not know this man. He may
      be a spy of Gian Maria&rsquo;s&mdash;a hireling paid to betray us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool,&rdquo; she answered sharply. &ldquo;Do you not see that it is the wounded
      knight we met that day you were escorting me to Urbino?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall that signify?&rdquo; demanded he. &ldquo;Is it proof of his honesty of
      purpose or loyalty to you? Be advised, Madonna, and let him deliver his
      message from where he is. He is safer there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She measured him with a determined eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga, order them to lower the bridge,&rdquo; she bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, lady, bethink you of your peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peril?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Peril from two men, and we a garrison of over
      twenty? Surely the man is a coward who talks so readily of perils. Have
      the drawbridge lowered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, with a desperate vehemence, when again
      she cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to be obeyed? Am I mistress, and will you bid them lower the bridge,
      or must I, myself, go see to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a look of despairing anger and a shrug of the shoulders he turned
      from her, and despatched one of his men with an order. A few moments
      later, with a creaking of hinges and a clanking of chains, the great
      bridge swung down and dropped with a thud to span the gulf. Instantly the
      Count spurred his horse forward, and followed by Lanciotto rode across the
      plank and under the archway of the entrance tower into the first
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, scarcely had he drawn rein there when through a door at the far end
      appeared the gigantic figure of Fortemani, half-clad and sword in hand. At
      sight of Francesco the fellow leaped down a half-dozen steps, and advanced
      towards him with a burst of oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me!&rdquo; he shouted, in a voice that might have waked the dead. &ldquo;Olá! Olá!
      What devil&rsquo;s work is this? How come you here? By whose orders was the
      bridge let down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the orders of Monna Valentina&rsquo;s captain,&rdquo; answered Francesco,
      wondering what madman might be this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; cried the other, coming to a standstill and his face turning
      purple. &ldquo;Body of Satan! What captain? I am captain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count looked him over in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are the very man I seek. I congratulate you on
      the watch you keep, Messer Capitano. Your castle is so excellently
      patrolled that had I been minded for a climb I had scaled your walls and
      got within your gates without arousing any of your slumbering sentries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani eyed him with a lowering glance. The prosperity of the past four
      days had increased the insolence inherent in the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your affair?&rdquo; he growled menacingly. &ldquo;You are over-bold, sir
      stranger, to seek a quarrel with me, and over-pert to tell me how I shall
      discharge my captaincy. By the Passion! You shall be punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punished&mdash;I?&rdquo; echoed Francesco, on whose brow there now descended a
      scowl as black as Ercole&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, punished, young sir. Ercole Fortemani is my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of you,&rdquo; answered the Count contemptuously, &ldquo;and of how you
      belie that name of yours, for they tell me that a more drunken, cowardly,
      good-for-nothing rogue is not to be found in Italy&mdash;no, not even in
      the Pope&rsquo;s dominions. And have a care how you cast the word &lsquo;punishment&rsquo; 
      at your betters, animal. The moat is none so distant, and the immersion
      may profit you. For I&rsquo;ll swear you&rsquo;ve not been washed since they baptized
      you&mdash;if, indeed, you be a son of Mother Church at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sangue di Cristo!&rdquo; spluttered the enraged bully, his face mottled. &ldquo;This
      to me? Come down from that horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid hold of Francesco&rsquo;s leg to drag him to the ground, but the Count
      wrenched it free by a quick motion that left a gash from his spur upon the
      captain&rsquo;s hands. Simultaneously he raised his whip, and would have laid
      the lash of it across the broad of Fortemani&rsquo;s back&mdash;for it had
      angered him beyond words to have a ruffian of this fellow&rsquo;s quality
      seeking to ruffle it with him&mdash;but at that moment a female voice,
      stern and imperative, bade them hold in their quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani fell back nursing his lacerated hand and muttering curses,
      whilst Francesco turned in the direction whence that voice had come.
      Midway on the flight of stone steps he beheld Valentina, followed by
      Gonzaga, Peppe, and a couple of men-at-arms, descending from the
      battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calm and queenly she stood, dressed in a camorra of grey velvet with black
      sleeves, which excellently set off her handsome height. Gonzaga was
      leaning forward, speaking into her ear, and for all that his voice was
      subdued, some of his words travelled down to Francesco on the still,
      morning air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not wise, Madonna, in that I hesitated to admit him? You see what
      manner of man he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood flamed in Francesco&rsquo;s cheeks, nor did it soften his chagrin to
      note the look which Valentina flashed down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he leapt to the ground, and flinging his reins to Lanciotto he
      went forward to the foot of that stone staircase, his broad hat slung back
      upon his shoulders, to meet that descending company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this seemly, sir?&rdquo; she questioned angrily. &ldquo;Does it become you to
      brawl with my garrison the moment you are admitted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rose higher in Francesco&rsquo;s face, and now suffused his temples
      and reached his hair. Yet his voice was well restrained as he made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, this knave was insolent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An insolence that you no doubt provoked,&rdquo; put in Gonzaga, a dimple
      showing on his woman&rsquo;s cheek. But the sterner rebuke fell from the lips of
      Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knave?&rdquo; she questioned, with flushed countenance. &ldquo;If you would not have
      me regret your admittance, Messer Francesco, I pray you curb your words.
      Here are no knaves. That, sir, is the captain of my soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco bowed submissively, as patient under her reproof as he had been
      hasty under Fortemani&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on the matter of this captaincy that we fell to words,&rdquo; he
      answered, with more humility. &ldquo;By his own announcement I understood this
      nobleman&rdquo;&mdash;and his eyes turned to Gonzaga&mdash;&ldquo;to be your captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the captain of my castle,&rdquo; she informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you see, Ser Francesco,&rdquo; put in Peppe, who had perched himself upon
      the balustrade, &ldquo;we suffer from no lack of captains here. We have also Fra
      Domenico, who is captain of our souls and of the kitchen; myself am
      captain of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take you, fool,&rdquo; snapped Gonzaga, thrusting him roughly from his
      perch. Then turning abruptly to the Count: &ldquo;You bear a message for us,
      sir?&rdquo; he questioned loftily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swallowing the cavalier tone, and overlooking the pronoun Gonzaga
      employed, Francesco inclined his head again to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer to deliver it in more privacy than this.&rdquo; And his eye
      travelled round the court and up the steps behind, where was now collected
      the entire company of Fortemani. Gonzaga sneered and tossed his golden
      curls, but Valentina saw naught unreasonable in the request, and bidding
      Romeo attend her and Francesco follow, she led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the quadrangle, and, mounting the steps down which Fortemani
      had dashed to meet the Count, they passed into the banqueting-hall, which
      opened directly upon the south side of the courtyard. The Count, following
      in her wake, ran the gauntlet of scowls of the assembled mercenaries. He
      stalked past them unmoved, taking their measure as he went, and estimating
      their true value with the unerring eye of the practised condottiero who
      has had to do with the enrolling of men and the handling of them. So
      little did he like their looks that on the threshold of the hall he paused
      and stayed Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am loath to leave my servant at the mercy of those ruffians, sir. May I
      beg that you will warn them against offering him violence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruffians?&rdquo; cried the lady angrily, before Gonzaga could offer a reply.
      &ldquo;They are my soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he bowed, and there was a cold politeness in the tones in which he
      answered her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave your pardon, and I will say no more&mdash;unless it be to deplore
      that I may not felicitate you on your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Gonzaga&rsquo;s turn to wax angry, for the choice had been his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your message will have need to be a weighty one, sir, to earn our
      patience for your impertinence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco returned the look of those blue eyes which vainly sought to
      flash ferociously, and he made little attempt to keep his scorn from
      showing in his glance. He permitted himself even to shrug his shoulders a
      trifle impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, I think that I had best begone,&rdquo; he answered regretfully,
      &ldquo;for it is a place whose inmates seem all bent on quarrelling with me.
      First your captain Fortemani greets me with an insolence hard to leave
      unpunished. You, yourself, Madonna, resent that I should crave protection
      for my man against those fellows whose looks give rise for my
      solicitation. You are angry that I should dub them ruffians, as if I had
      followed the calling of arms these ten years without acquiring knowledge
      of the quality of a man however much you may disguise him. And lastly, to
      crown all, this cicisbeo&rdquo;&mdash;and he spread a hand contemptuously
      towards Gonzaga&mdash;&ldquo;speaks of my impertinences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; cried Gonzaga, &ldquo;I beg that you will let me deal with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unwittingly, unwillingly, Gonzaga saved the situation by that prayer. The
      anger that was fast rising in Madonna&rsquo;s heart, stirred by the proud
      bearing of the Count, was scattered before the unconscious humour of her
      captain&rsquo;s appeal, in such ludicrous contrast was his mincing speech and
      slender figure with Francesco&rsquo;s firm tones and lean, active height. She
      did not laugh, for that would have been to have spoilt all, but she looked
      from one to the other with quiet relish, noting the glance of surprise and
      raised eyebrows with which the Count received the courtier&rsquo;s request to be
      let deal with him. And thus, being turned from anger, the balance of her
      mind was quick to adjust itself, and she bethought her that perhaps there
      was reason in what this knight advanced, and that his reception had lacked
      the courtesy that was his due. In a moment, with incomparable grace and
      skill, she had soothed Gonzaga&rsquo;s ruffled vanity, and appeased the Count&rsquo;s
      more sturdy resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Messer Francesco,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;let us be friends, and let me
      hear your business. I beg that you will sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had passed into the banqueting-hall&mdash;a noble apartment, whose
      walls were frescoed with hunting and pastoral scenes, one or two of which
      were the work of Pisaniello. There were, too, some stray trophies of the
      chase, and, here and there, a suit of costly armour that caught the
      sunlight pouring through the tall, mullioned windows. At the far end stood
      a richly carved screen of cedar, and above this appeared the twisted
      railing of the minstrels&rsquo; gallery. In a tall armchair of untanned leather,
      at the head of the capacious board, Monna Valentina sat herself, Gonzaga
      taking his stand at her elbow, and Francesco fronting her, leaning lightly
      against the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news I bear you, lady, is soon told,&rdquo; said the Count. &ldquo;I would its
      quality were better. Your suitor Gian Maria returning to Guidobaldo&rsquo;s
      court, eager for the nuptials that were promised him, has learnt of your
      flight to Roccaleone and is raising&mdash;indeed will have raised by now&mdash;an
      army to invest and reduce your fortress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga turned as pale as the vest of white silk that gleamed beneath his
      doublet of pearl-coloured velvet at this realisation of the prophecies he
      had uttered without believing. A sickly fear possessed his soul. What fate
      would they mete out to him who had been the leading spirit in Valentina&rsquo;s
      rebellion? He could have groaned aloud at this miscarriage of all his fine
      plans. Where now would be the time to talk of love, to press and carry his
      suit with Valentina and render himself her husband? There would be war in
      the air, and bloody work that made his skin creep and turn cold to ponder
      on. And the irony of it all was keenly cruel. It was the very contingency
      that he had prophesied, assured that neither Guidobaldo nor Gian Maria
      would be so mad as to court ridicule by engaging upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second Francesco&rsquo;s eyes rested on the courtier&rsquo;s face, and saw the
      fear written there for all to read. The shadow of a smile quivered on his
      lips as his glance moved on to meet the eyes of Valentina, sparkling as
      sparkles frost beneath the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, let them come!&rdquo; she exclaimed, almost in exultation. &ldquo;This ducal oaf
      shall find me very ready for him. We are armed at all points. We have
      victuals to last us three months, if need be, and we have no lack of
      weapons. Let Gian Maria come, and he will find Valentina della Rovere none
      so easy to reduce. To you, sir,&rdquo; she continued, with more calm, &ldquo;to you on
      whom I have no claim, I am more than grateful for your chivalrous act in
      riding here to warn me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco sighed; a look of regret crossed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I rode hither, Madonna, I had hoped to serve you to
      a better purpose. I had advice to offer and assistance if you should need
      it; but the sight of those men-at-arms of yours makes me fear that it is
      not advice upon which it would be wise to act. For the plan I had in mind,
      it would be of the first importance that your soldiers should be
      trustworthy, and this, I fear me, they are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; put in Gonzaga feverishly, clinging to a slender hope,
      &ldquo;let us hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg that you will,&rdquo; said Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus enjoined, Francesco pondered a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with the politics of Babbiano?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make the position quite clear to you, Madonna,&rdquo; he rejoined. And
      with that he told her of the threatened descent of Caesar Borgia upon Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s duchy, and hence, of the little time at her suitor&rsquo;s disposal; so
      that if he could but be held in check before the walls of Roccaleone for a
      little while, all might be well. &ldquo;But seeing in what haste he is,&rdquo; he
      ended, &ldquo;his methods are likely to be rough and desperate, and I had
      thought that meanwhile you need not remain here, Madonna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not remain?&rdquo; she cried, scorn of the notion in her voice. &ldquo;Not remain?&rdquo;
       quoth Gonzaga timorously, hope sounding in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely, Madonna. I would have proposed that you leave Gian Maria an
      empty nest, so that even if the castle should fall into his hands he would
      gain nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would advise me to fly?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came prepared to do so, but the sight of your men restrains me. They
      are not trustworthy, and to save their dirty skins they might throw
      Roccaleone open to the besiegers, and thus your flight would be
      discovered, while yet there might be time to render it futile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could frame an answer there was Gonzaga feverishly urging her
      to act upon so wise and timely a suggestion, and seek safety in flight
      from a place that Gian Maria would tear stone from stone. His words
      pattered quickly and piteously in entreaty, till in the end, facing him
      squarely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you afraid, Gonzaga?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;afraid for you, Madonna,&rdquo; he answered readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let your fears have peace. For whether I stay or whether I go, one
      thing is certain: Gian Maria never shall set hands upon me.&rdquo; She turned
      again to Francesco. &ldquo;I see a certain wisdom in the counsel of flight you
      would have offered me, no less than in what I take to be your advice that
      I should remain. Did I but consult my humour I should stay and deliver
      battle when this tyrant shows himself. But prudence, too, must be
      consulted, and I will give the matter thought.&rdquo; And now she thanked him
      with a generous charm for having come to her with this news and proffered
      his assistance, asking what motives brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such motives as must ever impel a knight to serve a lady in distress,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;and perhaps, too, the memory of the charity with which you
      tended my wounds that day at Acquasparta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a second their glances met, quivered in the meeting, and fell apart
      again, an odd confusion in the breast of each, all of which Gonzaga, sunk
      in moody rumination, observed not. To lighten the awkward silence that was
      fallen, she asked him how it had transpired so soon that it was to
      Roccaleone she had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Has not Peppe told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had no speech with him. He but reached the castle, himself, late
      last night, and I first saw him this morning when he came to announce your
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, before more could be said, there arose a din of shouting from
      without. The door was pushed suddenly open, and Peppe darted into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your man, Ser Francesco,&rdquo; he cried, his face white with excitement. &ldquo;Come
      quickly, or they will kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIV. FORTEMANI DRINKS WATER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The thing had begun with the lowering glances that Francesco had observed,
      and had grown to gibes and insults after he had disappeared. But Lanciotto
      had preserved an unruffled front, being a man schooled in the Count of
      Aquila&rsquo;s service to silence and a wondrous patience. This insensibility
      those hinds translated into cowardice, and emboldened by it&mdash;like the
      mongrels that they were&mdash;their offensiveness grew more direct and
      gradually more threatening. Lanciotto&rsquo;s patience was slowly oozing away,
      and indeed, it was no longer anything but the fear of provoking his
      master&rsquo;s anger that restrained him. At length one burly ruffian, who had
      bidden him remove his head-piece in the company of gentlemen, and whose
      request had been by Lanciotto as disregarded as the rest, advanced
      menacingly towards him and caught him by the leg, as Ercole had caught his
      master. Exasperated at that, Lanciotto had swung his leg free, and caught
      the rash fellow a vicious kick in the face that had felled him, stunned
      and bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar from the man&rsquo;s companions told Lanciotto what to expect. In an
      instant they were upon him, clamouring for his blood. He sought to draw
      his master&rsquo;s sword, which together with the Count&rsquo;s other armour was slung
      across his saddle-bow; but before he could extricate it, he was seized by
      a dozen hands, and cropped, fighting, from the saddle. On the ground they
      overpowered him, and a mailed hand was set upon his mouth, crushing back
      into his throat the cry for help he would have raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the west side of the courtyard a fountain issuing from the wall had
      once poured its water through a lion&rsquo;s head into a vast tank of moss-grown
      granite. But it had been disused for some time, and the pipe in the lion&rsquo;s
      mouth was dry. The tank, however, was more than half full of water, which,
      during the late untenanting of the castle, had turned foul and stagnant.
      To drown Lanciotto in this was the amiable suggestion that emanated from
      Fortemani himself&mdash;a suggestion uproariously received by his knaves,
      who set themselves to act upon it. They roughly dragged the bleeding and
      frantically struggling Lanciotto across the yard and gained the border of
      the tank, intending fully to sink him into it and hold him under, to drown
      there like a rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that instant a something burst upon him like a bolt from out of
      Heaven. In one or two, and presently in more, the cruel laughter turned to
      sudden howls of pain as a lash of bullock-hide caught them about head and
      face and shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back there, you beasts, you animals, back!&rdquo; roared a voice of thunder,
      and back they went unquestioning before that pitiless lash, like the pack
      of craven hounds they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Francesco, who, single-handed, and armed with no more than a whip,
      was scattering them from about his maltreated servant, as the hawk
      scatters a flight of noisy sparrows. And now between him and Lanciotto
      there stood no more than the broad bulk of Ercole Fortemani, his back to
      the Count; for, as yet, he had not realised the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco dropped his whip, and setting one hand at the captain&rsquo;s girdle,
      and the other at his dirty neck, he hoisted him up with a strength
      incredible, and hurled him from his path and into the slimy water of the
      tank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a mighty roar drowned in a mightier splash as Fortemani,
      spread-eagle, struck the surface and sank from sight, whilst with the
      flying spray there came a fetid odour to tell of the unsavouriness of that
      unexpected bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without pausing to see the completion of his work, Francesco stooped over
      his prostrate servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the beasts hurt you, Lanciotto?&rdquo; he questioned. But before the
      fellow could reply, one of those hinds had sprung upon the stooping Count,
      and struck him with a dagger between the shoulder-blades.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman&rsquo;s alarmed cry rang out, for Valentina was watching the affray from
      the steps of the hall, with Gonzaga at her elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Francesco&rsquo;s quilted brigandine had stood the test of steel, and the
      point of that assassin&rsquo;s dagger glanced harmlessly aside, doing no worse
      hurt than a rent in the silk surface of the garment. A second later the
      fellow found himself caught as in a bond of steel. The dagger was wrenched
      from his grasp, and the point of it laid against his breast even as the
      Count forced him down upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash was the thing done, yet to the wretched man who saw himself
      upon the threshold of Eternity, and who&mdash;like a true son of the
      Church&mdash;had a wholesome fear of hell, it seemed an hour whilst, with
      livid cheeks and eyes starting from his head, he waited for that poniard
      to sink into his heart, as it was aimed. But not in his heart did the blow
      fall. With a sudden snort of angry amusement, the Count pitched the dagger
      from him and brought down his clenched fist with a crushing force into the
      ruffian&rsquo;s face. The fellow sank unconscious beneath that mighty blow, and
      Francesco, regaining the whip that lay almost at his feet, rose up to
      confront what others there might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the tank, standing breast-deep in that stinking water, his head and
      face grotesquely masked in a vile green slime of putrid vegetation, Ercole
      Fortemani bellowed with horrid blasphemy that he would have his
      aggressor&rsquo;s blood, but stirred never a foot to take it. Not that he was by
      nature wholly a coward; but inspired by a wholesome fear of the man who
      could perform such a miracle of strength, he remained out of Francesco&rsquo;s
      reach, well in the middle of that square basin, and lustily roared orders
      to his men to tear the fellow to pieces. But his men had seen enough of
      the Count&rsquo;s methods, and made no advance upon that stalwart, dauntless
      figure that stood waiting for them with a whip which several had already
      tasted. Huddled together, more like a flock of frightened sheep than a
      body of men of war, they stood near the entrance tower, the mock of Peppe,
      who from the stone-gallery above&mdash;much to the amusement of
      Valentina&rsquo;s ladies and two pert pages that were with him&mdash;applauded
      in high-flown terms their wondrous valour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stirred at last, but it was at Valentina&rsquo;s bidding. She had been
      conferring with Gonzaga, who&mdash;giving it for his reason that she,
      herself, might need protection&mdash;had remained beside her, well out of
      the fray. She had been urging him to do something, and at last he had
      obeyed her, and moved down the short flight of steps into the court; but
      so reluctantly and slowly, that with an exclamation of impatience, she
      suddenly brushed past him, herself to do the task she had begged of him.
      Past Francesco she went, with a word of such commendation of his valour
      and a look of such deep admiration, that the blood sprang, responsive, to
      his cheek. She paused with a solicitous inquiry for the now risen but
      sorely bruised Lanciotto. She flashed an angry look and an angry command
      of silence at the great Ercole, still bellowing from his tank, and then,
      within ten paces of his followers, she halted, and with wrathful mien, and
      hand outstretched towards their captain, she bade them arrest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sudden, unexpected order struck dumb the vociferous Fortemani. He
      ceased, and gaped at his men, who eyed one another now in doubt; but the
      doubt was quickly dispelled by the lady&rsquo;s own words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make him prisoner, and conduct him to the guardroom, or I will
      have you and him swept out of my castle,&rdquo; she informed them, as
      confidently as though she had a hundred men-at-arms to do her bidding on
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pace or so behind her stood the lily-cheeked Gonzaga, gnawing his lip,
      timid and conjecturing. Behind him again loomed the stalwart height of
      Francesco del Falco with, at his side, Lanciotto, of mien almost as
      resolute as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the full force with which the lady spoke of sweeping them&mdash;as
      if they had been so much foulness&mdash;from Roccaleone, unless they did
      her bidding. They were still hesitating, when the Count advanced to
      Valentina&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard the choice our lady gives you,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;Let us
      know whether you will obey or disobey. This choice that is yours now, may
      not be yours again. But if you elect to disobey Madonna, the gate is
      behind you, the bridge still down. Get you gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Furtively, from under lowering brows, Gonzaga darted a look of impotent
      malice at the Count. Whatever issue had the affair, this man must not
      remain in Roccaleone. He was too strong, too dominant, and he would render
      himself master of the place by no other title than that strength of his
      and that manner of command which Gonzaga accounted a coarse, swashbuckling
      bully&rsquo;s gift, but would have given much to be possessed of. Of how strong
      and dominant indeed he was never had Francesco offered a more signal
      proof. Those men, bruised and maltreated by him, would beyond doubt have
      massed together and made short work of one less dauntless but when a
      mighty courage such as his goes hand-in-hand with the habit of command,
      such hinds as they can never long withstand it. They grumbled something
      among themselves, and one of them at last made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble sir, it is our captain that we are bidden to arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but your captain, like yourselves, is in this lady&rsquo;s pay; and she,
      your true, your paramount commander, bids you arrest him.&rdquo; And now, whilst
      yet they hesitated, his quick wits flung them the bait that must prove
      most attractive. &ldquo;He has shown himself to-day unfitted for the command
      entrusted him and it may become a question, when he has been judged, of
      choosing one of you to fill the place he may leave empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hinds were they in very truth; the scum of the bravi that haunted the
      meanest borgo of Urbino. Their hesitation vanished, and such slight
      loyalty as they felt towards Ercole was overruled by the prospect of his
      position and his pay, should his disgrace become accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called upon him to come forth from his refuge, where he still stood,
      dumb and stricken at this sudden turn events had taken. He sullenly
      refused to obey the call to yield, until Francesco&mdash;who now assumed
      command with a readiness that galled Gonzaga more and more&mdash;bade one
      of them go fetch an arquebuse and shoot the dog. At that he cried out for
      mercy, and came wading to the edge of the tank swearing that if the
      immersion had not drowned him, it were a miracle but he was poisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus closed an incident that had worn a mighty ugly look, and it served to
      open Valentina&rsquo;s eyes to the true quality of the men Gonzaga had hired
      her. Maybe that it opened his own for that amiable lute-thrummer was green
      of experience in these matters. She bade Gonzaga care for Francesco, and
      called one of the grinning pages from the gallery to be his esquire. A
      room was placed at his disposal for the little time that he might spend at
      Roccaleone, whilst she debated what her course should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bell tolled in the far southern wing of the castle, beyond the second
      courtyard, and summoned her to chapel, for there Fra Domenico said Mass
      each morning. And so she took her leave of Francesco, saying she would
      pray Heaven to direct her to a wise choice, whether to fly from
      Roccaleone, or whether to remain and ward off the onslaught of Gian Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco, attended by Gonzaga and the page, repaired to a handsome room
      under the Lion&rsquo;s Tower, which rose upon the south-eastern angle of the
      fortress. His windows overlooked the second, or inner, courtyard, across
      which Valentina and her ladies were now speeding on their way to Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga made shift to stifle the resentment that he felt against this man,
      in whom he saw an interloper, and strove to treat him with the courtesy
      that was his due. He would even have gone the length of discussing with
      him the situation&mdash;prompted by a certain mistrust, and cunningly
      eager to probe the real motive that had brought this stranger to interest
      himself in the affairs of Valentina. But Francesco, wearily, yet with an
      unimpeachable politeness, staved him off, and requested that Lanciotto
      might be sent to attend him. Seeing the futility of his endeavours,
      Gonzaga withdrew in increased resentment, but with a heightened sweetness
      of smile and profoundness of courtesies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went below to issue orders for the raising of the bridge, and finding
      the men singularly meek and tractable after the sharp lesson Francesco had
      read them, he vented upon them some of the vast ill-humour that possessed
      him. Next he passed on to his own apartments, and there he sat himself by
      a window overlooking the castle gardens, with his unpleasant thoughts for
      only company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently his mood lightened and he took courage, for he could be very
      brave when peril was remote. It was best, he reflected, that Valentina
      should leave Roccaleone. Such was the course he would advise and urge.
      Naturally, he would go with her, and so he might advance his suit as well
      elsewhere as in that castle. On the other hand, if she remained, why, so
      would he, and, after all, what if Gian Maria came? As Francesco had said,
      the siege could not be protracted, thanks to the tangled affairs of
      Babbiano. Soon Gian Maria would be forced to turn him homeward, to defend
      his Duchy. If, then, for a little while they could hold him in check, all
      would yet be well. Surely he had been over-quick to despond.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and stretched himself with indolent relish, then pushing wide his
      casement, he leaned out to breathe the morning air. A soft laugh escaped
      him. He had been a fool indeed to plague himself with fears when he had
      first heard of Gian Maria&rsquo;s coming. Properly viewed, it became a service
      Gian Maria did him&mdash;whether they remained, or whether they went. Love
      has no stronger promoter than a danger shared, and a week of such
      disturbances as Gian Maria was likely to occasion them should do more to
      advance his suit than he might hope to achieve in a whole month of
      peaceful wooing. Then the memory of Francesco set a wrinkle &lsquo;twixt his
      brows, and he bethought him how taken Valentina had been with the fellow
      when first she had beheld him at Acquasparta, and of how, as she rode that
      day, she had seen naught but the dark eyes of this Knight Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knight Francesco of what or where?&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Bah! A
      nameless, homeless adventurer; a swashbuckling bully, reeking of blood and
      leather, and fit to drive such a pack as Fortemani&rsquo;s. But with a lady&mdash;what
      shalt such an oaf attain, how shall he prevail?&rdquo; He laughed the incipient
      jealousy to scorn, and his brow grew clear, for now he was in an
      optimistic mood&mdash;perhaps a reaction from his recent tremors. &ldquo;Yet, by
      the Host!&rdquo; he pursued, bethinking him of the amazing boldness Francesco
      had shown in the courtyard, &ldquo;he has the strength of Hercules, and a way
      with him that makes him feared and obeyed. Pish!&rdquo; he laughed again, as,
      turning, he unhooked his lute from where it hung upon the wall. &ldquo;The
      by-blow of some condottiero, who blends with his father&rsquo;s bullying
      arrogance the peasant soul of his careless mother. And I fear that such a
      one as that shall touch the heart of my peerless Valentina? Why, it is a
      thought that does her but poor honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And dismissing Francesco from his mind, he sought the strings with his
      fingers, and thrummed an accompaniment as he returned to the window, his
      voice, wondrous sweet and tender, breaking into a gentle love-song.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. THE MERCY OF FRANCESCO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monna Valentina and her ladies dined at noon in a small chamber opening
      from the great hall, and thither were bidden Francesco and Gonzaga. The
      company was waited upon by the two pages, whilst Fra Domenico, with a
      snow-white apron girt about his portentous waist, brought up the steaming
      viands from the kitchen where he had prepared them; for, like a true
      conventual, he was something of a master in the confection&mdash;and a
      very glutton in the consumption&mdash;of delectable comestibles. The
      kitchen was to him as the shrine of some minor cult, and if his breviary
      and beads commanded from him the half of the ecstatic fervour of his
      devotions to pot and pan, to cauldron and to spit, then was canonisation
      indeed assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set before them that day a dinner than which a better no prince
      commanded, unless it were the Pope. There were ortolans, shot in the
      valley, done with truffles, that made the epicurean Gonzaga roll his eyes,
      translated through the medium of his palate into a very paradise of
      sensual delight. There was a hare, trapped on the hillside, and stewed in
      Malmsey, of a flavour so delicate that Gonzaga was regretting him his
      heavy indulgence in the ortolans; there was trout, fresh caught in the
      stream below, and a wondrous pasty that turned liquid in the mouth. To
      wash down these good things there was stout red wine of Puglia and more
      delicate Malvasia, for in his provisioning of the fortress Gonzaga had
      contrived that, at least, they should not go thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a garrison awaiting siege you fare mighty well at Roccaleone,&rdquo; was
      Francesco&rsquo;s comment on that excellent repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fool who answered him. He sat out of sight upon the floor,
      hunched against the chair of one of Valentina&rsquo;s ladies, who now and again
      would toss him down a morsel from her plate, much as she might have
      treated a favourite hound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the friar to thank for it,&rdquo; said he, in a muffled voice, for his
      mouth was crammed with pasty. &ldquo;Let me be damned when I die, if I make him
      not my confessor. The man who can so minister to bodies should deal
      amazingly well with souls. Fra Domenico, you shall confess me after
      sunset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need me not,&rdquo; answered the monk, in disdainful wrath. &ldquo;There is a
      beatitude for such as you&mdash;&lsquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there no curse for such as you?&rdquo; flashed back the fool. &ldquo;Does it
      say nowhere&mdash;&lsquo;Damned are the gross of flesh, the fat and rotund
      gluttons who fashion themselves a god of their own bellies&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his sandalled foot the friar caught the fool a surreptitious kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, you adder, you bag of venom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fearing worse, the fool gathered himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware!&rdquo; he cried shrilly. &ldquo;Bethink you, friar, that anger is a cardinal
      sin. Beware, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fra Domenico checked his upraised hand, and fell to muttering scraps of
      Latin, his lids veiling his suddenly down­cast eyes. Thus Peppe gained the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, friar; in my ear, now&mdash;Was that a hare you stewed, or an
      outworn sandal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, God forgive me,&rdquo; roared the monk, springing towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your cooking? Aye, pray&mdash;on your knees.&rdquo; He dodged a blow,
      ducked, and doubled back into the room. &ldquo;A cook, you? Pish! you tun of
      convent lard! Your ortolans were burnt, your trout swam in grease, your
      pasty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What the pasty may have been the company was not to learn, for Fra
      Domenico, crimson of face, had swooped down upon the fool, and would have
      caught him but that he dived under the table by Valentina&rsquo;s skirts, and
      craved her protection from this gross maniac that held himself a cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, hold your wrath, father,&rdquo; she said, laughing with the rest. &ldquo;He does
      but plague you. Bear with him for the sake of that beautitude you cited,
      which has fired him to reprisals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mollified, but still grumbling threats of a beating to be bestowed on
      Peppe when the opportunity should better serve him, the friar turned to
      his domestic duties. They rose soon after, and at Gonzaga&rsquo;s suggestion
      Valentina paused in the great hall to issue orders that Fortemani be
      brought before her for judgment. In a score of ways, since their coming to
      Roccaleone, had Ercole been wanting in that respect to which Gonzaga held
      himself entitled, and this opportunity he seized with eagerness to vent
      his vindictive rancour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina begged of Francesco that he, too, would stay, and help them with
      his wide experience, a phrase that sent an unpleasant pang through the
      heart of Romeo Gonzaga. It was perhaps as much to assert himself as to
      gratify his rancour against Fortemani, that, having despatched a soldier
      to fetch the prisoner, he turned to suggest curtly that Ercole should be
      hanged at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boots a trial?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;We were all witnesses of his
      insubordination, and for that there can be but one punishment. Let the
      animal hang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the trial is of your own suggestion,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Madonna. I but suggested judgment. It is since you have begged
      Messer Francesco, here, to assist us that I opine you mean to give the
      knave a trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you credit this dear Gonzaga with so much bloodthirstiness?&rdquo; she
      asked Francesco. &ldquo;Do you, sir, share his opinion that the captain should
      hang unheard? I fear me you do, for, from what I have seen of them, your
      ways do not incline to gentleness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga smiled, gathering from that sentence how truly she apprised the
      coarse nature of this stranger. Francesco&rsquo;s answer surprised them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I hold Messer Gonzaga&rsquo;s an ill counsel. Show mercy to Fortemani now,
      where he expects none, and you will have made a faithful servant of him. I
      know his kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ser Francesco speaks without the knowledge that we have, Madonna,&rdquo; was
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s rude comment. &ldquo;An example must be made if we would have respect
      and orderliness from these men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make it an example of mercy,&rdquo; suggested Francesco sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; was Valentina&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;I like your counsel, Messer
      Francesco, and yet I see a certain wisdom in Gonzaga&rsquo;s words. Though in
      such a case as this I would sooner consort with folly than have a man&rsquo;s
      death upon my conscience. But here he comes, and, at least, we&rsquo;ll give him
      trial. Maybe he is penitent by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga sneered, and took his place on the right of Valentina&rsquo;s chair,
      Francesco standing on her left; and in this fashion they disposed
      themselves to hold judgment upon the captain of her forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was brought in between two mailed men-at-arms, his hands pinioned
      behind him, his tread heavy as that of a man in fear, his eyes directed
      sullenly upon the waiting trio, but sullenest of all upon Francesco, who
      had so signally encompassed his discomfiture. Valentina spread a hand to
      Gonzaga, and from Gonzaga waved it slightly in the direction of the Bully.
      Responsive to that gesture, Gonzaga faced the pinioned captain
      truculently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know your offence, knave,&rdquo; he bawled at him. &ldquo;Have you aught to urge
      that may deter us from hanging you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani raised his brows a moment in surprise at this ferocity from one
      whom he had always deemed a very woman. Then he uttered a laugh of such
      contempt that the colour sprang to Gonzaga&rsquo;s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began furiously, when Valentina
      interposed, setting a hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, Gonzaga, your methods are all wrong. Tell him&mdash;&mdash;
      Nay, I will question him myself. Messer Fortemani, you have been guilty of
      an act of gross abuse. You and your men were hired for me by Messer
      Gonzaga, and to you was given the honourable office of captain over them,
      that you might lead them in this service of mine in the ways of duty,
      submission, and loyalty. Instead of that, you were the instigator of that
      outrage this morning, when murder was almost done upon an inoffensive man
      who was my guest. What have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I was not the instigator,&rdquo; he answered sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all one,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;for at least it was done with your
      sanction, and you took a share in that cruel sport, instead of restraining
      it, as was clearly your duty. It is upon you, the captain, that the
      responsibility rests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;they are wild souls, but very true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True to their wildness, maybe,&rdquo; she answered him disdainfully. Then she
      proceeded: &ldquo;You will remember that twice before has Messer Gonzaga had
      occasion to admonish you. These last two nights your men have behaved
      riotously within my walls. There has been hard drinking, there has been
      dicing, and such brawling once or twice as led me to think there would be
      throats cut among your ranks. You were warned by Messer Gonzaga to hold
      your followers in better leash, and yet to-day, without so much as
      drunkenness to excuse them, we have this vile affair, with yourself for a
      ringleader in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a pause, during which Ercole stood with bent head like one
      who thinks, and Francesco turned his wonder-laden glance upon this slight
      girl with the gentle brown eyes which had been so tender and pitiful.
      Marvelling at the greatness of her spirit, he grew&mdash;all unconsciously&mdash;the
      more enslaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga, all unconcerned in this, eyed Fortemani in expectation of his
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; said the bully at last, &ldquo;what can you look for from such a
      troop as this? Messer Gonzaga cannot have expected me to enlist acolytes
      for a business that he told me bordered upon outlawry. Touching their
      drunkenness and the trifle of rioting, what soldiers have not these
      faults? When they have them not, neither have they merit. The man that is
      tame in times of peace is a skulking woman in times of war. For the rest,
      whence came the wine they drank? It was of Messer Gonzaga&rsquo;s providing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, hound!&rdquo; blazed Gonzaga. &ldquo;I provided wine for Madonna&rsquo;s table,
      not for the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet some found its way to them; which is well. For water on the stomach
      makes a man poor-spirited. Where is the sin of a little indulgence,
      Madonna?&rdquo; he went on, turning again to Valentina. &ldquo;These men of mine will
      prove their mettle when it comes to blows. They are dogs perhaps&mdash;but
      mastiffs every one of them, and would lose a hundred lives in your service
      if they had them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, if they had them,&rdquo; put in Gonzaga sourly; &ldquo;but having no more than
      one apiece, they&rsquo;ll not care to spare it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, there you wrong them,&rdquo; cried Fortemani, with heat. &ldquo;Give them a
      leader strong enough to hold them, to encourage and subject them, and they
      will go anywhere at his bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there,&rdquo; put in Gonzaga quickly, &ldquo;you bring us back to the main issue.
      Such a leader you have shown us that you are not. You have done worse. You
      have been insubordinate when you should not only have been orderly, but
      have enforced orderliness in others. And for that, by my lights, you
      should be hanged. Waste no more time on him, Madonna,&rdquo; he concluded,
      turning to Valentina. &ldquo;Let the example be made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Madonna&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Fortemani, paling under the tan of his
      rugged countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga silenced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words are vain. You have been insubordinate, and for insubordination
      there is but one penalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bully hung his head, deeming himself lost, and lacking the wit to
      retort as Francesco unexpectedly retorted for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, there your adviser is at fault. The charge against the man is
      wrong. There has been no insubordination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; she questioned, turning to the Count. &ldquo;None, say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Solomon is arisen,&rdquo; sneered Gonzaga. Then peevishly; &ldquo;Waste not words
      with him, Madonna,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;Our business is with Fortemani.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stay, my good Gonzaga. He may be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your heart is over-tender,&rdquo; answered Romeo impatiently. But she had
      turned from him now, and was begging Francesco to make his meaning
      clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had he raised his hand against you, Madonna, or even against Messer
      Gonzaga, or had he disobeyed an order given him by either of you, then,
      and then only, could there be question of insubordination. But he has done
      none of these things. He is guilty of grossly misusing my servant, it is
      true, but there is no insubordination in that, since he was under no
      promise of loyalty to Lanciotto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stared at him as though his words were words of recondite wisdom
      instead of the simple statement of a plain case. Gonzaga crestfallen,
      Fortemani with a light of hope and wonder shining in his eyes, and Madonna
      with a faint nodding of the head that argued agreement. They wrangled a
      while yet, Gonzaga bitter and vindictive and rashly scornful of both
      Francesco and Fortemani. But the Count so resolutely held the ground he
      had taken that in the end Valentina shrugged her shoulders, acknowledged
      herself convinced, and bade Francesco deliver judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in earnest, Madonna?&rdquo; quoth Francesco in surprise, whilst a black
      scowl disfigured the serenity of Gonzaga&rsquo;s brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am indeed. Deal with him as you account best and most just, and it
      shall fare with him precisely as you ordain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco turned to the men-at-arms. &ldquo;Unbind him, one of you,&rdquo; he said
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that you are mad,&rdquo; cried Gonzaga, in a frenzy, but his mood
      sprang rather from the chagrin of seeing his interloper prevail where he
      had failed. &ldquo;Madonna, do not heed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you let be, my good Gonzaga,&rdquo; she answered soothingly, and
      Gonzaga, ready to faint from spite, obeyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him there, and go,&rdquo; was Paolo&rsquo;s next order to the men, and they
      departed, leaving the astonished Fortemani standing alone, unbound and
      sheepish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now mark me well, Messer Fortemani,&rdquo; Francesco admonished him. &ldquo;You did a
      cowardly thing, unworthy of the soldier that you would have men believe
      you. And for that, I think, the punishment you received at my hands has
      been sufficient, in that the indignity to which I submitted you has shaken
      your standing with your followers. Go back to them now and retrieve what
      you have lost, and see that in the future you are worthier. Let this be a
      lesson to you, Messer Fortemani. You have gone perilously near hanging,
      and you have had it proved to you that in moments of peril your men are
      ready to raise their hands against you. Why is that? Because you have not
      sought their respect. You have been too much a fellow of theirs in their
      drinking and their brawling, instead of holding yourself aloof with
      dignity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, I have learnt my lesson!&rdquo; answered the cowed bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then act upon it. Resume your command, and discipline your men to a
      better order. Madonna, here, and Messer Gonzaga will forget this thing. Is
      it not so, Madonna? Is it not so, Messer Gonzaga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swayed by his will and by an intuition that told her that to whatever end
      he might be working, he was working wisely, Valentina gave Fortemani the
      assurance Francesco begged, and Gonzaga was forced grudgingly to follow
      her example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani bowed low, his face pale and his limbs trembling as not even
      fear had made them tremble. He advanced towards Valentina, and sinking on
      one knee, he humbly kissed the hem of her gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your clemency, Madonna, shall give you no regret. I will serve you to the
      death, lady, and you, lord.&rdquo; At the last words he raised his eyes to
      Francesco&rsquo;s calm face. Then, without so much as a glance at the
      disappointed Gonzaga, he rose, and bowing again&mdash;a very courtier&mdash;he
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing of the door was to Gonzaga a signal to break out in a torrent
      of bitter reproofs against Francesco, reproofs that were stemmed midway by
      Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beside yourself, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What has been done,
      has been done with my sanction. I do not doubt the wisdom of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not? God send you never may! But that man will know no peace until
      he is avenged on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga,&rdquo; returned Francesco, with an incomparable politeness, &ldquo;I
      am an older man than are you, and maybe that I have seen more warring and
      more of such men. There is a certain valour lurks in that bully for all
      his blustering boastfulness and swagger, and there is, too, a certain
      sense of justice. Mercy he has had to-day, and time will show how right I
      am in having pardoned him in Madonna&rsquo;s name. I tell you, sir, that nowhere
      has Monna Valentina a more faithful servant than he is now likely to
      become.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, Messer Francesco. Indeed, I am sure your act was wisdom
      itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga gnawed his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be wrong,&rdquo; said he, in grudging acquiescence. &ldquo;I hope, indeed, I
      may be.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. GONZAGA UNMASKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The four great outer walls of Roccaleone stood ranged into a mighty
      square, of which the castle proper occupied but half. The other half,
      running from north to south, was a stretch of garden, broken into three
      terraces. The highest of these was no more than a narrow alley under the
      southern wall, roofed from end to end by a trellis of vines on beams
      blackened with age, supported by uprights of granite, square and roughly
      hewn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A steep flight of granite steps, weedy in the interstices of the old
      stone, and terminating in a pair of couchant lions at the base, led down
      to the middle terrace, which was called the upper garden. This was split
      in twain by a very gallery of gigantic box trees running down towards the
      lower terrace, and bearing eloquent witness to the age of that old garden.
      Into this gallery no sun ever penetrated by more than a furtive ray, and
      on the hottest day in summer a grateful cool dwelt in its green gloom.
      Rose gardens spread on either side of it, but neglect of late had left
      them rank with weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third and lowest of these terraces, which was longer and broader than
      either of those above, was no more than a smooth stretch of lawn, bordered
      by acacias and plane trees, from the extreme corner of which sprang a
      winding, iron-railed staircase of stone, leading to an eerie which
      corresponded diagonally with the Lion&rsquo;s Tower, where the Count of Aquila
      was lodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this green lawn Valentina&rsquo;s ladies and a page beguiled the eventide in
      a game of bowls, their clumsiness at the unwonted pastime provoking the
      good-humoured banter of Peppe, who looked on, and their own still
      better-humoured laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani, too, was there, brazening out the morning&rsquo;s affair, which it
      almost seemed he must have forgotten, so self-possessed and mightily at
      his ease was he. He was of the kind with whom shame strikes never very
      deeply, and he ruffled it gaily there, among the women, rolling his fierce
      eyes to ogle them seductively, tossing his gaudy new cloak with a
      high-born disdain&mdash;gloriously conscious that it would not rend in the
      tossing, like the cloaks to which grim Circumstance had lately accustomed
      him&mdash;and strutting it like any cock upon a dunghill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lesson he had learnt was not likely to share the same
      forgetfulness. Indeed, its fruits were to be observed already in the more
      orderly conduct of his men, four of whom, partisan on shoulder, were doing
      duty on the walls of the castle. They had greeted his return amongst them
      with sneers and derisive allusions to his immersion, but with a few
      choicely-aimed blows he had cuffed the noisiest into silence and a more
      subservient humour. He had spoken to them in a rasping, truculent tone,
      issuing orders that he meant should be obeyed, unless the disobeyer were
      eager for a reckoning with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, he was an altered man, and when that night his followers, having
      drunk what he accounted enough for their good, and disregarding his orders
      that they should desist and get them to bed, he went in quest of Monna
      Valentina. He found her in conversation with Francesco and Gonzaga, seated
      in the loggia of the dining-room. They had been there since supper,
      discussing the wisdom of going or remaining, of fleeing or standing firm
      to receive Gian Maria. Their conference was interrupted now by Ercole with
      his complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      She despatched Gonzaga to quell the men, a course that Fortemani treated
      to a covert sneer. The fop went rejoicing at this proof that her estimate
      of his commanding qualities had nowise suffered by contrast with those of
      that swashbuckling Francesco. But his pride rode him to a bitter fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made a mock of his remonstrances, and when he emulated Francesco&rsquo;s
      methods, addressing them with sharp ferocity, and dubbing them beasts and
      swine, they caught the false ring of his fierceness, which was as unlike
      the true as the ring of lead is unlike that of silver. They jeered him
      insults, they mimicked his tenor voice, which excitement had rendered
      shrill, and they bade him go thrum a lute for his lady&rsquo;s delectation, and
      leave men&rsquo;s work to men.
    </p>
    <p>
      His anger rose, and they lost patience; and from showing their teeth in
      laughter, they began to show them in snarls. At this his ferocity deserted
      him. Brushing past Fortemani, who stood cold and contemptuous by the
      doorway, watching the failure he had expected, he returned with burning
      cheeks and bitter words to Madonna Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dismayed at the tale he bore her, magnified to cover his own
      shame. Francesco sat quietly drumming on the sill, his eyes upon the
      moonlit garden below, and never by word or sign suggesting that he might
      succeed where Romeo had failed. At last she turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; she began, and stopped, her eyes wandering back
      to Gonzaga, loath to further wound a pride that was very sore already. On
      the instant Francesco rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might try, Madonna,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;although Messer Gonzaga&rsquo;s
      failure gives me little hope. And yet, it may be that he has taken the
      keen edge from their assurance, and that, thus, an easier task awaits me.
      I will try, Madonna.&rdquo; And with that he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will succeed, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she said, after he had gone. &ldquo;He is a man of
      war, and knows the words to which these fellows have no answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish him well of his errand,&rdquo; sneered Gonzaga, his pretty face white
      now with sullenness. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll wager you he fails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Valentina disdained the offer whose rashness was more than proven
      when, at the end of some ten minutes, Francesco re-entered, as
      imperturbable as when he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are quiet now, Madonna,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him questioningly. &ldquo;How did you accomplish it?&rdquo; she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a little difficulty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yet not over-much.&rdquo; His eye roved
      to Gonzaga, and he smiled. &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga is too gentle with them. Too
      true a courtier to avail himself of the brutality that is necessary when
      we deal with brutes. You should not disdain to use your hands upon them,&rdquo;
       he admonished the fop in all seriousness, and without a trace of irony.
      Nor did Gonzaga suspect any.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, soil my hands on that vermin?&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of horror. &ldquo;I
      would die sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else soon after,&rdquo; squeaked Peppe, who had entered unobserved. &ldquo;Patrona
      mia, you should have seen this paladin,&rdquo; he continued, coming forward.
      &ldquo;Why, Orlando was never half so furious as he when he stood there telling
      them what manner of dirt they were, and bidding them to bed ere he drove
      them with a broomstick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they went?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at first,&rdquo; said the fool. &ldquo;They had drunk enough to make them very
      brave, and one who was very drunk was so brave as to assault him. But Ser
      Francesco fells him with his hands, and calling Fortemani he bids him have
      the man dropped in a dungeon to grow sober. Then, without waiting so much
      as to see his orders carried out, he stalks away, assured that no more was
      needed. Nor was it. They rose up, muttering a curse or two, maybe&mdash;yet
      not so loud that it might reach the ears of Fortemani&mdash;and got
      themselves to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked again at Francesco with admiring eyes, and spoke of his
      audacity in commending terms. This he belittled; but she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen much warring, sir,&rdquo; she half-asked, half­asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Madonna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And here the writhing Gonzaga espied his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not call to mind your name, good sir,&rdquo; he purred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco half-turned towards him, and for all that his mind was working
      with a lightning quickness, his face was indolently calm. To disclose his
      true identity he deemed unwise, for all connected with the Sforza brood
      must earn mistrust at the hands of Valentina. It was known that the Count
      of Aquila stood high in the favour of Gian Maria, and the news of his
      sudden fall and banishment could not have reached Guidobaldo&rsquo;s niece, who
      had fled before the knowledge of it was in Urbino. His name would awaken
      suspicion, and any story of disgrace and banishment might be accounted the
      very mask to fit a spy. There was this sleek, venomous Gonzaga, whom she
      trusted and relied on, to whisper insidiously into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; he said serenely, &ldquo;is, as I have told you. Francesco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have another?&rdquo; quoth Valentina, interest prompting the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, but so closely allied to the first as to be scarce worth
      reciting. I am Francesco Franceschi, a wandering knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a true one, as I know.&rdquo; She smiled at him so sweetly that Gonzaga was
      enraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard the name before,&rdquo; he murmured, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father was&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman of Tuscany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not at Court?&rdquo; suggested Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, at Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with a sly insolence that brought the blood to Francesco&rsquo;s cheeks,
      though to the chaste mind of Valentina&rsquo;s it meant nothing&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he
      rejoined. &ldquo;But then, your mother&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was more discriminating, sir, than yours,&rdquo; came the sharp answer, and
      from the shadows the fool&rsquo;s smothered burst of laughter added gall to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga rose heavily, drawing a sharp breath, and the two men stabbed each
      other with their eyes. Valentina, uncomprehending, looked from one to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs, sirs, what have you said?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why all this war of looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is over-quick to take offence, Madonna, for an honest man,&rdquo; was
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Like the snake in the grass, he is very ready with his
      sting when we seek to disclose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she cried, now rising too. &ldquo;What are you saying? Are
      you turned witless? Come, sirs, since you are both my friends, be friends
      each with the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most perfect syllogism!&rdquo; murmured the fool, unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Messer Francesco, forget his words. He means them not. He is
      very hot of fancy, but sweet at heart, this good Gonzaga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the instant the cloud lifted from Francesco&rsquo;s brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, since you ask me,&rdquo; he answered, inclining his head, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;ll but
      say he meant no malice by his words, I will confess as much for mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga, cooling, saw that haply he had gone too fast, and was the readier
      to make amends. Yet in his bosom he nursed an added store of poison, a
      breath of which escaped him as he was leaving Valentina, and after
      Francesco had already gone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I mistrust that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistrust him? Why?&rdquo; she asked, frowning despite her faith in the
      magnificent Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not why; but it is here. I feel it.&rdquo; And with his hand he touched
      the region of his heart. &ldquo;Say that he is no spy, and call me a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll do both,&rdquo; she laughed. Then more sternly, added: &ldquo;Get you to
      bed, Gonzaga. Your wits play you false. Peppino, call my ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the moment that they were left alone he stepped close up to her,
      spurred to madness by the jealous pangs he had that day endured. His face
      gleamed white in the candlelight, and in his eyes there was a lurking
      fierceness that gave her pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your way, Madonna,&rdquo; he said, in a concentrated voice; &ldquo;but
      to-morrow, whether we go hence, or whether we stay, he remains not with
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up to the full of her slender, graceful height, her eyes
      on a level with Gonzaga&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;is as shall be decreed by me or him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He breathed sharply, and his voice hardened beyond belief in one usually
      so gentle of tone and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be warned, Madonna,&rdquo; he muttered, coming so close that with the slightest
      swaying she must touch him, &ldquo;that if this nameless sbirro shall ever dare
      to stand &lsquo;twixt you and me, by God and His saints, I&rsquo;ll kill him! Be
      warned, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the door re-opening at that moment, he fell back, bowed, and brushing
      past the entering ladies, gained the threshold. Here someone tugged at the
      prodigious foliated sleeves that spread beside him on the air like the
      wings of a bird. He turned, and saw Peppino motioning him to lower his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word in your ear, Magnificent. There was a man once went out for wool
      that came back shorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angrily cuffing the fool aside, he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina sank down upon her window-seat, in a turmoil of mingled anger
      and amazement that paled her cheek and set her bosom heaving. It was the
      first hint of his aims respecting her that Gonzaga had ever dared let
      fall, and the condition in which it left her boded ill for his ultimate
      success. Her anger he could have borne, had he beheld it, for he would
      have laid it to the score of the tone he had taken with her. But her
      incredulity that he could indeed have dared to mean that which her senses
      told her he had meant, would have shown him how hopeless was his case and
      how affronted, how outraged in soul she had been left by this moment of
      passionate self-revealing. He would have understood then that in her eyes
      he never had been, was never like to be, aught but a servant&mdash;and
      one, hereafter, that, deeming presumptuous, she would keep at greater
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he, dreaming little of this as he paced his chamber, smiled at his
      thoughts, which flowed with ready optimism. He had been a fool to give way
      so soon, perhaps. The season was not yet; the fruit was not ripe enough
      for plucking; still, what should it signify that he had given the tree a
      slight premonitory shake? A little premature, perhaps, but it would
      predispose the fruit to fall. He bethought him of her never-varying
      kindness to him, her fond gentleness, and he lacked the wit to see that
      this was no more than the natural sweetness that flowed from her as freely
      as flows the perfume from the flower&mdash;because Nature has so fashioned
      it, and not because Messer Gonzaga likes the smell. Lacking that wit, he
      went in blissful confidence to bed, and smiled himself softly to his
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away in the room under the Lion&rsquo;s Tower, the Count of Aquila, too, paced
      his chamber ere he sought his couch, and in his pacing caught sight of
      something that arrested his attention, and provoked a smile. In a corner,
      among his harness which Lanciotto had piled there, his shield threw back
      the light, displaying the Sforza lion quartered with the Aquila eagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my sweet Gonzaga get a glimpse of that he would have no further need
      to pry into my parentage,&rdquo; he mused. And dragging the escutcheon from
      amongst that heap of armour, he softly opened his window and flung it far
      out, so that it dropped with a splash into the moat. That done, he went to
      bed, and he, too, fell asleep with a smile upon his lips, and in his mind
      a floating vision of Valentina. She needed a strong and ready hand to
      guide her in this rebellion against the love-at-arms of Gian Maria, and
      that hand he swore should be his, unless she scorned the offer of it. And
      so, murmuring her name with a lingering fervour, of whose true
      significance he was all-nescient, he sank to sleep, nor waked again until
      a thundering at his door aroused him. And to his still dormant senses came
      the voice of Lanciotto, laden with hurry and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awake, lord! Up, afoot! We are beset.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. THE ENEMY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Count leapt from his bed, and hastened to throw wide the door to admit
      his servant, who with excited face and voice bore him the news that Gian
      Maria had reached Roccaleone in the night, and was now encamped in the
      plain before the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still at his tale when a page came with the message that Monna
      Valentina besought Messer Francesco&rsquo;s presence in the great hall. He
      dressed in all haste, and then, with Lanciotto at his heels, he descended
      to answer her summons. As he crossed the second courtyard he beheld
      Valentina&rsquo;s ladies grouped upon the chapel-steps in excited discussion of
      this happening with Fra Domenico, who, in full canonicals, was waiting to
      say the morning&rsquo;s Mass. He gave them a courteous &ldquo;Good morrow,&rdquo; and passed
      on to the banqueting-hall, leaving Lanciotto without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he found Valentina in conference with Fortemani. She was pacing the
      great room as she talked; but, beyond that, there was no sign of
      excitement in her bearing, and if any fear of the issue touched her heart
      now that the moment for action was at hand, it was wondrously
      well-suppressed. At sight of Francesco, a look that was partly dismay and
      partly pleasure lighted her face. She greeted him with such a smile as she
      would bestow in that hour upon none but a trusted friend. Then, with a
      look of regret:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am beyond measure grieved, sir, that you should thus stand committed to
      my fortunes. They will have told you that already we are besieged, and so
      you will see how your fate is now bound up with ours. For I fear me there
      is no road hence for you until Gian Maria raises this siege. The choice of
      going or remaining is no longer mine. We must remain, and fight this
      battle out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least, lady,&rdquo; he answered readily, gaily almost, &ldquo;I cannot share your
      regrets for me. The act of yours may be a madness, Madonna, but it is the
      bravest, sweetest madness that ever was, and I shall be proud to play my
      part if you&rsquo;ll assign me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, I have no claim upon you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The claim that every beset lady has upon a true knight,&rdquo; he assured her.
      &ldquo;I could ask no better employment for these arms of mine than in your
      defence against the Duke of Babbiano. I am at your service, and with a
      glad heart, Monna Valentina. I have seen something of war, and you may
      find me useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him Provost of Roccaleone, Madonna,&rdquo; urged Fortemani, whose
      gratitude to the man who had saved his life was blent with an admiring
      appreciation of his powers, of which the bully had had such practical
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear what Ercole says?&rdquo; she cried, turning to Francesco with a sudden
      eagerness that showed how welcome that suggestion was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were too great an honour,&rdquo; he answered solemnly. &ldquo;Yet, if you were to
      place in my hands that trust, I would defend it to my last breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, before she could answer him, Gonzaga entered by the side-door,
      and frowned to see Francesco there before him. He was a trifle pale, he
      carried his cloak on the right shoulder, instead of the left, and in
      general his apparel was less meticulous than usual, and showed signs of
      hasty donning. With a curt nod to the Count, and an utter ignoring of
      Fortemani&mdash;who was scowling upon him in memory of yesterday&mdash;he
      bowed low before Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am distraught, Madonna&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, when she cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have little cause to be. Have things fallen out other than we
      expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. Yet I had hoped that Gian Maria would not allow his humour
      to carry him so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had hoped that&mdash;after the message Messer Francesco brought us?&rdquo;
       And she looked him over with an eye of sudden understanding. &ldquo;Yet you
      expressed no such hope when you advised this flight to Roccaleone. You
      were all for fighting then. A martial ardour consumed you. Whence this
      change? Is it the imminence of danger that gives it a reality too grim for
      your appetite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a scorn in her words that wounded him as she meant it should.
      His last night&rsquo;s rashness had shown her the need to leave him in no false
      opinion of the extent of her esteem, and, in addition, those last words of
      his had shown him revealed in a new light, and she liked him the less by
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head slightly, shame blazing red in his cheeks, that he
      should be thus reproved before Fortemani and that upstart Francesco. That
      Francesco was an upstart was no longer a matter of surmise with him. His
      soul assured him of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he said, with some show of dignity, ignoring her gibes, &ldquo;I came
      to bear you news that a herald from Gian Maria craves a hearing. Shall I
      hold parley with him for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too good,&rdquo; she answered sweetly. &ldquo;I will hear the man myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed submissively, and then his eye moved to Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might arrange with him for the safe-conduct of this gentleman,&rdquo; he
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no hope they would accord it,&rdquo; she answered easily. &ldquo;Nor could I
      hope so if they would, for Messer Francesco has consented to fill the
      office of Provost of Roccaleone. But we are keeping the messenger waiting.
      Sirs, will you attend me to the ramparts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They bowed, and followed her, Gonzaga coming last, his tread heavy as a
      drunkard&rsquo;s, his face white to the lips in the bitter rage with which he
      saw himself superseded, and read his answer to the hot words that last
      night he had whispered in Valentina&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the courtyard Francesco discharged the first act of his
      new office in ordering a half-dozen men-at-arms to fall in behind them, to
      the end that they might make some show upon the wall when they came to
      parley with the herald.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a tall man on a tall, grey horse, whose polished helm shone
      like silver in the morning sun, and whose haubergeon was almost hidden
      under a crimson tabard ornamented with the Sforza lion. He bowed low as
      Valentina appeared, followed by her escort, foremost in which stood the
      Count of Aquila, his broad castor pulled down upon his brow, so that it
      left his face in shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of my master, the High and Mighty Lord Gian Maria Sforza,
      Duke of Babbiano, I call upon you to yield, lady, laying down your arms
      and throwing open your gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a pause, at the end of which she asked him was that the sum
      of his message, or was there something that he had forgotten. The herald,
      bowing gracefully upon the arched neck of his caracoling palfrey, answered
      her that what he had said was all he had been bidden say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned with a bewildered and rather helpless look to those behind her.
      She wished that the matter might be conducted with due dignity, and her
      convent rearing left her in doubt of how this might best be achieved. She
      addressed herself to Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give him his answer, my Lord Provost,&rdquo; she said, with a smile,
      and Francesco, stepping forward and leaning on a merlon of that embattled
      wall, obeyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Herald,&rdquo; he said, in a gruff voice that was unlike his own, &ldquo;will you
      tell me since when has the Duke of Babbiano been at war with Urbino that
      he should thus beset one of its fortresses, and demand the surrender of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Highness,&rdquo; replied the herald, &ldquo;is acting with the full sanction of
      the Duke of Urbino in sending this message to the Lady Valentina della
      Rovere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that Valentina elbowed the Count aside, and forgetting her purpose of
      conducting this affair with dignity, she let her woman&rsquo;s tongue deliver
      the answer of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This message, sir, and the presence here of your master, is but another
      of the impertinences that I have suffered at his hands, and it is the
      crowning one. Take you that message back to him, and tell him that when I
      am instructed by what right he dares to send you upon such an errand, I
      may render him an answer more germane with his challenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you prefer, Madonna, that his Highness should come himself to speak
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing I should prefer less. Already has necessity compelled me
      to have more to say to Gian Maria than I could have wished.&rdquo; And with a
      proud gesture she signified that the audience was at an end, and turned to
      quit the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a brief conference with Francesco, during which he consulted her
      as to certain measures of defence to be taken, and made suggestions, to
      all of which she agreed, her hopes rising fast to see that here, at least,
      she had a man with knowledge of the work to which he had set his hand. It
      lightened her heart and gave her a glad confidence to look on that
      straight, martial figure, the hand so familiarly resting on the hilt of
      the sword that seemed a part of him, and the eyes so calm; whilst when he
      spoke of perils, they seemed to dwindle &lsquo;neath the disdain of them so
      manifest in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Fortemani at his heels he went about the execution of the measures he
      had suggested, the bully following him now with the faithful wonder of a
      dog for its master, realising that here, indeed, was a soldier of fortune
      by comparison with whom the likes of himself were no better than
      camp-followers. Confidence, too, did Ercole gather from that magnetism of
      Francesco&rsquo;s unfaltering confidence; for he seemed to treat the matter as a
      great jest, a comedy played for the Duke of Babbiano and at that same
      Duke&rsquo;s expense. And just as Francesco&rsquo;s brisk tone breathed confidence
      into Fortemani and Valentina, so, too, did it breathe it into Fortemani&rsquo;s
      wretched followers. They grew zestful in the reflection of his zest, and
      out of admiration for him they came to admire the business on which they
      were engaged, and, finally, to take a pride in the part he assigned to
      each of them. Within an hour there was such diligent bustle in Roccaleone,
      such an air of grim gaiety and high spirits, that Valentina, observing it,
      wondered what manner of magician was this she had raised to the command of
      her fortress, who in so little time could work so marvellous a change in
      the demeanour of her garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once only did Francesco&rsquo;s light-heartedness fail him, and this was when,
      upon visiting the armoury, he found but one single cask of gunpowder
      stored there. He turned to Fortemani to inquire where Gonzaga had bestowed
      it, and Fortemani being as ignorant as himself upon the subject he went
      forthwith in quest of Gonzaga. After ransacking the castle for him, he
      found him pacing the vine-alley in the garden in animated conversation
      with Valentina. At his approach the courtier&rsquo;s manner grew more subdued,
      and his brows sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga,&rdquo; Francesco hailed him. The courtier, surprised, looked
      up. &ldquo;Where have you hidden your store of powder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Powder?&rdquo; faltered Gonzaga, chilled by a sudden apprehension. &ldquo;Is there
      none in the armoury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;one small cask, enough to load a cannon once or twice, leaving
      us nothing for our hand-guns. Is that your store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is all there is in the armoury, that is all we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Franceseo stood speechless, staring at him, a dull flush creeping into his
      cheeks. In that moment of wrath he forgot their positions, and gave never
      a thought to the smarting that must be with Gonzaga at the loss of rank he
      had suffered since Valentina had appointed a provost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are these your methods of fortifying Roccaleone?&rdquo; he asked, in a
      voice that cut like a knife. &ldquo;You have laid in good store of wine, a flock
      of sheep, and endless delicacies, sir,&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;Did you expect to pelt
      the enemy with these, or did you reckon upon no enemy at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this question touched so closely upon the truth, that it fired in
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s bosom an anger that for the moment made a man of him. It was the
      last breath that blew into a blaze the smouldering wrath he carried in his
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      His retort came fierce and hot. It was as unmeasured and contemptuous as
      Francesco&rsquo;s erst recriminations, and it terminated in a challenge to the
      Count to meet him on horse or foot, with sword or lance, and that as soon
      as might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Valentina intervened, and rebuked them both. Yet to Francesco her
      rebuke was courteous, and ended in a prayer that he should do the best
      with such resources as Roccaleone offered; to Gonzaga it was contemptuous
      in the last degree, for Francesco&rsquo;s question&mdash;which Gonzaga had left
      unanswered&mdash;coming at a moment when she was full of suspicions of
      Gonzaga, and the ends he had sought to serve in advising her upon a course
      which he had since shown himself so utterly unfitted to guide, had opened
      wide her eyes. She remembered how strangely moved he had been upon
      learning yesterday that Gian Maria was marching upon Roccaleone, and how
      ardently he had advised flight from the fortress&mdash;he that had so
      bravely talked of holding it against the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were still wrangling there in a most unseemly fashion when a
      trumpet-blast reached them from beyond the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The herald again,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come, Messer Francesco, let us hear what
      fresh message he brings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led Francesco away, leaving Gonzaga in the shadow of the vines,
      reduced well-nigh to tears in the extremity of his mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The herald was returned with the announcement that Valentina&rsquo;s answer left
      Gian Maria no alternative but to await the arrival of Duke Guidobaldo, who
      was then marching to join him. The Duke of Urbino&rsquo;s presence would be, he
      thought, ample justification in her eyes for the challenge Gian Maria had
      sent, and which he would send again when her uncle arrived to confirm it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter, the remainder of the day was passed in peace at Roccaleone, if
      we except the very hell of unrest that surged in the heart of Romeo
      Gonzaga. He sat disregarded at supper that evening, save by Valentina&rsquo;s
      ladies and the fool, who occasionally rallied him upon his glumness.
      Valentina herself turned her whole attention to the Count, and whilst
      Gonzaga&mdash;Gonzaga, the poet of burning fancy, the gay songster, the
      acknowledged wit, the mirror of courtliness&mdash;was silent and
      tongue-tied, this ruffling, upstart swashbuckler entertained them with a
      sprightliness that won him every heart&mdash;always excepting that of
      Romeo Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco made light of the siege in a manner that enlivened every soul
      present with relief. He grew merry at the expense of Gian Maria, and made
      it very plain that he could have found naught more captivating to his
      warlike fancy than this business upon which an accident had embarked him.
      He was as full of confidence for the issue as he was full of eager
      anticipation of the fray itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it wonderful that&mdash;never having known any but artificial men; men
      of court and ante-chamber; men of dainty ways and mincing, affected tricks
      of speech; in short, such men as circumstance ordains shall surround the
      great&mdash;Monna Valentina&rsquo;s eyes should open very wide, the better to
      behold this new pattern of a man, who, whilst clearly a gentleman of high
      degree, carried with him an air of the camp rather than the camerion, was
      imbued by a spirit of chivalry and adventure, and ignored with a certain
      lofty dignity, as if beneath his observance, the poses that she was wont
      to see characterising the demeanour of the gentlemen of his Highness, her
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was young, moreover, yet no longer callow; comely, yet with a strong
      male comeliness; he had a pleasantly modulated voice, yet one that they
      had heard swell into a compelling note of command; he had the most joyous,
      careless laugh in all the world&mdash;such a laugh as endears a man to all
      that hear it&mdash;and he indulged it without stint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga sat glum and moody, his heart bursting with the resentment of the
      mean and the incompetent for the man of brilliant parts. But the morrow
      was to bring him worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Urbino arrived next morning, and rode up to the moat in
      person, attended only by a trumpeter, who, for the third time, wound a
      note of challenge to the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As on the previous day, Valentina answered the summons, attended by
      Francesco, Fortemani and Gonzaga&mdash;the latter uninvited yet not
      denied, and following sullenly in her train, in a last, despairing attempt
      to assert himself one of her captains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco had put on his harness, and came arrayed from head to foot in
      resplendent steel, to do worthy honour to the occasion. A bunch of plumes
      nodded in his helm, and for all that his beaver was open, yet the shadows
      of the head-piece afforded at the distance sufficient concealment to his
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of her uncle left Valentina unmoved. Well-beloved though he was
      of his people, between himself and his niece he had made no effort ever to
      establish relations of affection. Less than ever did he now seek to
      prevail by the voice of kinship. He came in the panoply of war, as a
      prince to a rebel subject, and in precisely such a tone did he greet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monna Valentina,&rdquo; he said&mdash;seeming entirely to overlook the
      circumstance that she was his kinswoman&mdash;&ldquo;deeply though this
      rebellion grieves me, you are not to think that your sex shall gain you
      any privileges or any clemency. We will treat you precisely as we would
      any other rebel subject who acted as you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Highness,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I solicit no privilege beyond that to which my
      sex gives me the absolute right, and which has no concern with war and
      arms. I allude to the privilege of disposing of myself, my hand and heart,
      as it shall please me. Until you come to recognise that I am a woman
      endowed with a woman&rsquo;s nature, and until, having realised it, you are
      prepared to submit to it, and pass me your princely word to urge the Duke
      of Babbiano&rsquo;s suit no further with me, here will I stay in spite of you,
      your men-at-arms, and your paltry ally, Gian Maria, who imagines that love
      may be made successfully in armour, and that a way to a woman&rsquo;s heart is
      to be opened with cannon-shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we shall bring you to a more subjective and dutiful frame of
      mind, Madonna,&rdquo; was the grim answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dutiful to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the State, a princess of which you have had the honour to be born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of my duty to myself, to my heart, and to my womanhood? Is no
      account to be taken of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are matters, Madonna, that are not to be discussed in shouts from
      the walls of a castle&mdash;nor, indeed, do I wish to discuss them
      anywhere. I am here to summon you to surrender. If you resist us, you do
      so at your peril.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then at my peril I will resist you&mdash;gladly. I defy you. Do your
      worst against me, disgrace your manhood and the very name of chivalry by
      whatsoever violence may occur to you, yet I promise you that Valentina
      della Rovere never shall become the wife of his Highness of Babbiano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse to open your gates?&rdquo; he returned, in a voice that shook with
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utterly and finally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think to persist in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as I have life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince laughed sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wash my hands of the affair and of its consequences,&rdquo; he answered
      grimly. &ldquo;I leave it in the care of your future husband, Gian Maria Sforza,
      and if, in his very natural eagerness for the nuptials, he uses your
      castle roughly, the blame of it must rest with you. But what he does, he
      does with my full sanction, and I have come hither to advise you of it
      since you appeared in doubt. I beg that you will remain there for a few
      moments, to hear what his Highness himself may have to say. I trust his
      eloquence may prove more persuasive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saluted ceremoniously, and, wheeling his horse about, he rode away.
      Valentina would have withdrawn, but Francesco urged her to remain, and
      await the Duke of Babbiano&rsquo;s coming. And so they paced the battlements,
      Valentina in earnest talk with Francesco, Gonzaga following in moody
      silence with Fortemani, and devouring them with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From their eminence they surveyed the bustling camp in the plain, where
      tents, green, brown, and white, were being hastily erected by
      half-stripped soldiers. The little army altogether, may have numbered a
      hundred men, which, in his vainglory, Gian Maria accounted all that would
      be needed to reduce Roccaleone. But the most formidable portion of his
      forces rolled into the field even as they watched. It was heralded by a
      hoarse groaning of the wheels of bullock-carts to the number of ten, on
      each of which was borne a cannon. Other carts followed with ammunition and
      victuals for the men encamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked on with interest at the busy scene that was toward, and as
      they watched they saw Guidobaldo ride into the heart of the camp, and
      dismount. Then from out of a tent more roomy and imposing than the rest
      advanced the short, stout figure of Gian Maria, not to be recognised at
      that distance save by the keen eyes of Francesco that were familiar with
      his shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      A groom held a horse for him and assisted him to mount, and then, attended
      by the same trumpeter that had escorted Guidobaldo, he rode forward
      towards the castle. At the edge of the moat he halted, and at sight of
      Valentina and her company, he doffed his feathered hat, and bowed his
      straw-coloured head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monna Valentina,&rdquo; he called, and when she stepped forth in answer, he
      raised his little, cruel eyes in a malicious glance and showed the round
      moon of his white face to be whiter even, than its wont&mdash;a pallor
      atrabilious and almost green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grieved that his Highness, your uncle, should not have prevailed
      with you. Where he has failed, I may have little hope of succeeding&mdash;by
      the persuasion of words. Yet I would beg you to allow me to have speech of
      your captain, whoever he may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My captains are here in attendance,&rdquo; she answered tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! You have a plurality of them; to command&mdash;how many men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; roared Francesco, interposing, his voice sounding hollow from
      his helmet, &ldquo;to blow you and your woman besieging scullions to perdition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke stirred on his horse, and peered up at the speaker. But there was
      too little of his face visible for recognition, whilst his voice was
      altered and his figure dissembled in its steel casing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, rogue?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rogue in your teeth, be you twenty times a Duke,&rdquo; returned the other, at
      which Valentina laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never from the day when he had uttered his first wail had his Highness of
      Babbiano heard words of such import from the lips of living man. A purple
      flush mottled his cheeks at the indignity of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attend to me, knave!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Whatever betide the rest of this
      misguided garrison when ultimately it falls into my hands, for you I can
      promise a rope and a cross-beam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; sneered the knight. &ldquo;First catch your bird. Be none so sure that
      Roccaleone ever will fall into your hands. While I live you do not enter
      here, and my life, Highness, is for me a precious thing, which I&rsquo;ll not
      part with lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentina&rsquo;s eyes were mirthless now as she turned them upon that gleaming,
      martial figure standing so proudly at her side, and seeming so
      well-attuned to the proud defiance he hurled at the princely bully below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, sir!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Do not anger him further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; groaned Gonzaga, &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name say no more, or you&rsquo;ll undo us
      hopelessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; said the Duke, without further heeding Francesco, &ldquo;I give you
      twenty-four hours in which to resolve upon your action. Yonder you see
      them bringing the cannon into camp. When you wake to-morrow you shall find
      those guns trained upon your walls. Meanwhile, enough said. May I speak a
      word with Messer Gonzaga ere I depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you depart, you may say a word to whom you will,&rdquo; she answered
      contemptuously. And, turning aside, she motioned Gonzaga to the crenel she
      abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear that mincing jester is trembling already with the fear of what
      is to come,&rdquo; bawled the Duke, &ldquo;and perhaps fear will show him the way to
      reason. Messer Gonzaga!&rdquo; he called, raising his voice. &ldquo;As I believe the
      men of Roccaleone are in your service, I call upon you to bid them throw
      down that drawbridge, and in the name of Guidobaldo as well as my own, I
      promise them free pardon and no hurt&mdash;saving only that rascal at your
      side. But if your knaves resist me, I promise you that when I shall have
      dashed Roccaleone stone from stone, not a man of you all will I spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shaking like an aspen Gonzaga stood there, his voice palsied and making no
      reply, whereupon Francesco leant forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have heard your terms,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and we are not like to heed
      them. Waste not the day in vain threats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, my terms were not for you. I know you not; I addressed you not, nor
      will I suffer myself to be addressed by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Linger there another moment,&rdquo; answered the vibrating voice of the knight,
      &ldquo;and you will find yourself addressed with a volley of arquebuse-shot.
      Olá, there!&rdquo; he commanded, turning and addressing an imaginary body of men
      on the lower ramparts of the garden, to his left. &ldquo;Arquebusiers to the
      postern! Blow your matches! Make ready! Now, my Lord Duke, will you draw
      off, or must we blow you off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Duke&rsquo;s reply took the form of a bunch of blasphemous threats of how he
      would serve his interlocutor when he came to set hands on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present arms!&rdquo; roared the knight to his imaginary arquebusiers,
      whereupon, without another word, the Duke turned his horse and rode off in
      disgraceful haste, his trumpeter following hot upon his heels, pursued by
      a derisive burst of laughter from Francesco.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. TREACHERY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; gulped Gonzaga, as they were descending from the battlements, &ldquo;you
      will end by having us all hanged. Was that a way to address a prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentina frowned that he should dare rebuke her knight. But Francesco
      only laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By St. Paul! How would you have had me address him?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Would
      you have had me use cajolery with him&mdash;the lout? Would you have had
      me plead mercy from him, and beg him, in honeyed words, to be patient with
      a wilful lady? Let be, Messer Gonzaga, we shall weather it yet, never
      doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga&rsquo;s courage seems of a quality that wanes as the need for it
      increases,&rdquo; said Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are confounding courage, Madonna, with foolhardy recklessness,&rdquo; the
      courtier returned. &ldquo;You may learn it to your undoing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Gonzaga was not the only one entertaining this opinion they were soon
      to learn, for, as they reached the courtyard a burly, black-browed
      ruffian, Cappoccio by name, thrust himself in their path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word with you, Messer Gonzaga, and you, Ser Ercole.&rdquo; His attitude was
      full of truculent insolence, and all paused, Francesco and Valentina
      turning from him to the two men whom he addressed, and waiting to hear
      what he might have to say to them. &ldquo;When I accepted service under you, I
      was given to understand that I was entering a business that should entail
      little risk to my skin. I was told that probably there would be no
      fighting, and that if there were, it would be no more than a brush with
      the Duke&rsquo;s men. So, too, did you assure my comrades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you indeed?&rdquo; quoth Valentina, intervening, and addressing herself to
      Fortemani, to whom Cappoccio&rsquo;s words had been directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, Madonna,&rdquo; answered Ercole. &ldquo;But I had Messer Gonzaga&rsquo;s word for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you,&rdquo; she continued, turning to Gonzaga, &ldquo;permit their engagement on
      that understanding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On some such understanding, yes, Madonna,&rdquo; he was forced to confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a moment in amazement. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Msser Gonzaga,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;I think that I begin to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cappoccio, who was nowise interested in the extent of Valentina&rsquo;s
      knowledge of the man, broke in impetuously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we have heard what has passed between this new Provost here and his
      Highness of Babbiano. We have heard the terms that were offered, and his
      rejection of them, and I am come to tell you, Ser Ercole, and you, Messer
      Gonzaga, that I for one will not remain here to be hanged when Roccaleone
      shall fall into the hands of Gian Maria. And there are others of my
      comrades who are of the same mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Valentina looked at the rugged, determined features of the man, and fear
      for the first time stole into her heart and was reflected on her
      countenance. She was half-turning to Gonzaga, to vent upon him some of the
      bitterness of her humour&mdash;for him she accounted to blame&mdash;when
      once again Francesco came to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, shame on you, Cappoccio, for a paltry hind! Are these words for the
      ears of a besieged and sorely harassed lady, craven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no craven,&rdquo; the man answered hoarsely, his face flushing under the
      whip of Francesco&rsquo;s scorn. &ldquo;Out in the open I will take my chances, and
      fight in any cause that pays me. But this is not my trade&mdash;this
      waiting for the death of a trapped rat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesco met his eyes steadily for a moment, then glanced at the other
      men, to the number of a half-score or so&mdash;all, in fact, whom the
      duties he had apportioned them did not hold elsewhere. They hung in the
      rear of Cappoccio, all ears for what was being said, and their
      countenances plainly showing how their feelings were in sympathy with
      their spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you a soldier, Cappoccio?&rdquo; sneered Francesco. &ldquo;Shall I tell you in
      what Fortemani was wrong when he enlisted you? He was wrong in not hiring
      you for scullion duty in the castle kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Knight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Do you raise your voice to me? Do you think I am of your kind,
      animal, to be affrighted by sounds&mdash;however hideous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not affrighted by sounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not? Why, then, all this ado about a bunch of empty threats cast
      at us by the Duke of Babbiano? If you were indeed the soldier you would
      have us think you, would you come here and say, &lsquo;I will not die this way,
      or that&rsquo;? Confess yourself a boaster when you tell us that you are ready
      to die in the open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! That am I not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you are ready to die out there, why not in here? Shall it
      signify aught to him that dies where he gets his dying done? But reassure
      yourself, you woman,&rdquo; he added, with a laugh, and in a voice loud enough
      to be heard by the others, &ldquo;you are not going to die&mdash;neither here,
      nor there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Roccaleone capitulates&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not capitulate,&rdquo; thundered Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;when it is taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor will it be taken,&rdquo; the Provost insisted, with an assurance that
      carried conviction. &ldquo;If Gian Maria had time unlimited at his command, he
      might starve us into submission. But he has not. An enemy is menacing his
      own frontiers, and in a few days&mdash;a week, at most&mdash;he will be
      forced to get him hence to defend his crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greater reason for him to use stern measures and bombard us as he
      threatens,&rdquo; answered Cappoccio shrewdly but rather in the tone of a man
      who expects to have his argument disproved. And Francesco, if he could not
      disprove it, could at least contradict it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it not,&rdquo; he cried, with a scornful laugh. &ldquo;I tell you that Gian
      Maria will never dare so much. And if he did, are these walls that will
      crumble at a few cannon-shots? Assault he might attempt; but I need not
      tell a soldier that twenty men who are stout and resolute, as I will
      believe you are for all your craven words, could hold so strong a place as
      this against the assault of twenty times the men the Duke has with him.
      And for the rest, if you think I tell you more than I believe myself, I
      ask you to remember how I am included in Gian Maria&rsquo;s threat. I am but a
      soldier like you, and such risks as are yours are mine as well. Do you see
      any sign of faltering in me, any sign of doubting the issue, or any fear
      of a rope that shall touch me no more than it shall touch you? There,
      Cappoccio! A less merciful provost would have hanged you for your words&mdash;for
      they reek of sedition. Yet I have stood and argued with you, because I
      cannot spare a brave man such as you will prove yourself. Let us hear no
      more of your doubtings. They are unworthy. Be brave and resolute, and you
      shall find yourself well rewarded when the baffled Duke shall be forced to
      raise this siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned without waiting for the reply of Cappoccio&mdash;who stood
      crestfallen, his cheeks reddened by shame of his threat to get him hence&mdash;and
      conducted Valentina calmly across the yard and up the steps of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his way never to show a doubt that his orders would be obeyed, yet
      on this occasion scarce had the door of the hall closed after them when he
      turned sharply to the following Ercole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get you an arquebuse,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;and take my man Lanciotto, with
      you. Should those dogs still prove mutinous, fire into any that attempt
      the gates&mdash;fire to kill&mdash;and send me word. But above all,
      Ercole, do not let them see you or suspect your presence; that were to
      undermine such effect as my words may have produced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From out of a woefully pale face Valentina raised her brown eyes to his,
      in a look that was as a stab to the observing Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needed a man here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I think that Heaven it must have
      been that sent you to my aid. But do you think,&rdquo; she asked, and with her
      eyes she closely scanned his face for any sign of doubt, &ldquo;that they are
      pacified?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am assured of it, Madonna. Come, there are signs of tears in your eyes,
      and&mdash;by my soul!&mdash;there is naught to weep at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am but a woman, after all,&rdquo; she smiled up at him, &ldquo;and so, subject to a
      woman&rsquo;s weakness. It seemed as if the end were indeed come just now. It
      had come, but for you. If they should mutiny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall not, while I am here,&rdquo; he answered, with a cheering
      confidence. And she, full of faith in this true knight of hers, went to
      seek her ladies, and to soothe in her turn any alarm to which they might
      have fallen a prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco went to disarm, and Gonzaga to take the air upon the ramparts,
      his heart a very bag of gall. His hatred for the interloper was as nothing
      now to his rage against Valentina, a rage that had its birth in a
      wondering uncomprehension of how she should prefer that coarse,
      swashbuckling bully to himself, the peerless Gonzaga. And as he walked
      there, under the noontide sky, the memory of Francesco&rsquo;s assurance that
      the men would not mutiny returned to him, and he caught himself most
      ardently desiring that they might, if only to bear it home to Valentina
      how misplaced was her trust, how foolish her belief in that loud boaster.
      He thought next&mdash;and with increasing bitterness&mdash;of his own
      brave schemes, of his love for Valentina, and of how assured he had been
      that his affections were returned, before this ruffler came amongst them.
      He laughed in bitter scorn as the thought returned to her preferring
      Francesco to himself. Well, it might be so now&mdash;now that the times
      were warlike, and this Francesco was such a man as shone at his best in
      them. But what manner of companion would this sbirro make in times of
      peace? Had he the wit, the grace, the beauty even that was Gonzaga&rsquo;s?
      Circumstance, it seemed to him, was here to blame, and he roundly cursed
      that same Circumstance. In other surroundings, he was assured that she
      would not have cast an eye upon Francesco whilst he, himself, was by; and
      if he recalled their first meeting at Acquasparta, it was again to curse
      Circumstance for having placed the knight in such case as to appeal to the
      tenderness that is a part of woman&rsquo;s nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected&mdash;assured that he was right&mdash;that if Francesco had
      not come to Roccaleone, he might by now have been wed to Valentina; and
      once wed, he could throw down the bridge and march out of Roccaleone,
      assured that Gian Maria would not care to espouse his widow, and no less
      assured that Guidobaldo&mdash;who was at heart a kind and clement prince&mdash;would
      be content to let be what was accomplished, since there would be naught
      gained beyond his niece&rsquo;s widowhood in hanging Gonzaga. It was the
      specious argument that had lured him upon this rash enterprise, the hopes
      that he was confident would have fructified but for the interloping of
      Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking down at the tented plain, with black rage and black
      despair blotting the beauty from the sunlight of that May morning, and
      then it came to him that since there was naught to be hoped from his old
      plans, might it not be wise to turn his attention to new ones that would,
      at least, save him from hanging? For he was assured that whatever might
      betide the others, his own fate was sealed, whether Roccaleone fell or
      not. It would be remembered against him that the affair was of his
      instigating, and from neither Gian Maria nor Guidobaldo might he look for
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the thought of extricating himself from his desperate peril turned
      him cold by its suddenness. He stood very still a moment; then looked
      about him as though he feared that some watching spy might read on him the
      ugly intention that of a sudden had leapt to life in his heart. Swiftly it
      spread, and took more definite shape, the reflection of it showing now
      upon his smooth, handsome face, and disfiguring it beyond belief. He drew
      away from the wall, and took a turn or two upon the ramparts, one hand
      behind him, the other raised to support his drooping chin. Thus he brooded
      for a little while. Then, with another of his furtive glances, he turned
      to the north-western tower, and entered the armoury. There he rummaged
      until he had found the pen, ink and paper that he sought, and with the
      door wide open&mdash;the better that he might hear the sound of
      approaching steps&mdash;he set himself feverishly to write. It was soon
      done, and he stood up, waving the sheet to dry the ink. Then he looked it
      over again, and this is what he had written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it in my power to stir the garrison to mutiny and to throw open
      the gates of Roccaleone. Thus shall the castle fall immediately into your
      hands, and you shall have a proof of how little I am in sympathy with this
      rebellion of Monna Valentina&rsquo;s. What terms do you offer me if I accomplish
      this? Answer me now, and by the same means as I am employing, but dispatch
      not your answer if I show myself upon the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ROMEO GONZAGA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He folded the paper, and on the back he wrote the superscription&mdash;&ldquo;To
      the High and Mighty Duke of Babbiano.&rdquo; Then opening a large chest that
      stood against the wall, he rummaged a moment, and at last withdrew an
      arbalest quarrel. About the body of this he tied his note. Next, from the
      wall he took down a cross-bow, and from a corner a moulinet for winding
      it. With his foot in the stirrup he made the cord taut and set the shaft
      in position.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he closed the door, and, going to the window, which was little
      more than an arrow-slit, he shouldered his arbalest. He took careful aim
      in the direction of the ducal tent, and loosed the quarrel. He watched its
      light, and it almost thrilled him with pride in his archery to see it
      strike the tent at which he had aimed, and set the canvas shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment there was a commotion. Men ran to the spot, others emerged
      from the tent, and amongst the latter Gonzaga recognised the figures of
      Gian Maria and Guidobaldo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bolt was delivered to the Duke of Babbiano, who, with an upward glance
      at the ramparts, vanished into the tent once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga moved from his eerie, and set wide the door of the tower, so that
      his eyes could range the whole of the sun-bathed ramparts. Returning to
      his window, he waited impatiently for the answer. Nor was his impatience
      to endure long. At the end of some ten minutes Gian Maria reappeared, and,
      summoning an archer to his side, he delivered him something and made a
      motion of his hand towards Roccaleone. Gonzaga moved to the door, and
      stood listening breathlessly. At the least sign of an approach, he would
      have shown himself, and thus, by the provision made in his letter have
      cautioned the archer against shooting his bolt. But all was quiet, and so
      Gonzaga remained where he was until something flashed like a bird across
      his vision, struck sharply against the posterior wall, and fell with a
      tinkle on the broad stones of the rampart. A moment later the answer from
      Gian Maria was in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swiftly unwound it from the shaft that had brought it, and dropped the
      bolt into a corner. Then unfolding the letter, he read it, leaning against
      one of the merlons of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can devise a means to deliver Roccaleone at once into my hands you
      shall earn my gratitude, full pardon for your share in Monna Valentina&rsquo;s
      rebellion, and the sum of a thousand gold florins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GIAN MARIA.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he read, a light of joy leapt to his eyes. Gian Maria&rsquo;s terms were very
      generous. He would accept them, and Valentina should realise when too late
      upon what manner of broken reed she leaned in relying upon Messer
      Francesco. Would he save her now, as he so loudly boasted? Would there
      indeed be no mutiny, as he so confidently prophesied? Gonzaga chuckled
      evilly to himself. She should learn her lesson, and when she was Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s wife, she might perhaps repent her of her treatment of Romeo
      Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly to himself. Then suddenly he turned cold, and he felt
      his skin roughening. A stealthy step sounded behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crumpled the Duke&rsquo;s letter in his hand, and in the alarm of the moment,
      he dropped it over the wall. Seeking vainly to compose the features that a
      chilling fear had now disturbed, he turned to see who came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind him stood Peppe, his solemn eyes bent with uncanny intentness upon
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were seeking me?&rdquo; quoth Romeo, and the quaver in his voice sorted ill
      with his arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool made him a grotesque bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monna Valentina desires that you attend her in the garden, Illustrious.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peppe&rsquo;s quick eyes had seen Gonzaga crumple and drop the paper, no less
      than he had observed the courtier&rsquo;s startled face, and his suspicions had
      been aroused. He was by nature prying, and experience had taught him that
      the things men seek to conceal are usually the very things it imports most
      to have knowledge of. So when Gonzaga had gone, in obedience to
      Valentina&rsquo;s summons, the jester peered carefully over the battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he saw nothing, and he was concluding with disappointment that
      the thing Gonzaga had cast from him was lost in the torrential waters of
      the moat. But presently, lodged on a jutting stone, above the foaming
      stream into which it would seem that a miracle had prevented it from
      falling, he espied a ball of crumpled paper. He observed with satisfaction
      that it lay some ten feet immediately below the postern-gate by the
      drawbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secretly, for it was not Peppy&rsquo;s way to take men into his confidence where
      it might be avoided, he got himself a coil of rope. Having descended and
      quietly opened the postern, he made one end fast and lowered the other to
      the water with extreme care, lest he should dislodge, and so lose, that
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuring himself again that he was unobserved, he went down, hand over
      hand, like a monkey, his feet against the rough-hewn granite of the wall.
      Then, with a little swinging of the rope, he brought himself nearer that
      crumpled ball, his legs now dangling in the angry water, and by a mighty
      stretch that all but precipitated him into the torrent, he seized the
      paper and transferred it to his teeth. Then hand over hand again, and with
      a frantic haste, for he feared observation not only from the castle
      sentries but also from the watchers in the besieger&rsquo;s camp, he climbed
      back to the postern, exulting in that he had gone unobserved, and
      contemptuous for the vigilance of those that should have observed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly he closed the wicket, locked it and shot home the bolts at top and
      base, and went to replace the key on its nail in the guard-room, which he
      found untenanted. Next, with that mysterious letter in his hand, he
      scampered off across the courtyard and through the porch leading to the
      domestic quarters, nor paused until he had gained the kitchen, where Fra
      Domenico was roasting the quarter of a lamb that he had that morning
      butchered. For now that the siege was established, there was no more fish
      from the brook, nor hares and ortolans from the country-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar cursed the fool roundly, as was his wont upon every occasion,
      for he was none so holy that he disdained the milder forms of objurgatory
      oaths. But Peppe for once had no vicious answer ready, a matter that led
      the Dominican to ask him was he ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never heeding him, the fool unfolded and smoothed the crumpled paper in a
      corner by the fire. He read it and whistled, then stuffed it into the
      bosom of his absurd tunic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; quoth the friar. &ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A recipe for a dish of friar&rsquo;s brains. A most rare delicacy, and rendered
      costly by virtue of the scarcity of the ingredients.&rdquo; And with that answer
      Peppe was gone, leaving the monk with an ugly look in his eyes, and an
      unuttered imprecation on his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straight to the Count of Aquila went the fool with his letter. Francesco
      read it, and questioned him closely as to what he knew of the manner in
      which it had come into Gonzaga&rsquo;s possession. For the rest, those lines,
      far from causing him the uneasiness Peppe expected, seemed a source of
      satisfaction and assurance to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He offers a thousand gold florins,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;in addition to
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s liberty and advancement. Why, then, I have said no more than was
      true when I assured the men that Gian Maria was but idly threatening us
      with bombardment. Keep this matter secret, Peppe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will watch Messer Gonzaga?&rdquo; quoth the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch him? Why, where is the need? You do not imagine him so vile that
      this offer could tempt him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peppe looked up, his great, whimsical face screwed into an expression of
      cunning doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not think, lord, that he invited it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, shame on you for that thought. Messer Gonzaga may be an idle
      lute-thrummer, a poor-spirited coward; but a traitor&mdash;&mdash;! And to
      betray Monna Valentina! No, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the fool was far from reassured. He had had the longer acquaintance of
      Messer Gonzaga, and his shrewd eyes had long since taken the man&rsquo;s exact
      measure. Let Francesco scorn the notion of betrayal at Romeo&rsquo;s hands;
      Peppe would dog him like a shadow. This he did for the remainder of that
      day, clinging to Gonzaga as if he loved him dearly, and furtively
      observing the man&rsquo;s demeanour. Yet he saw nothing to confirm his
      suspicions beyond a certain preoccupied moodiness on the courtier&rsquo;s part.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, as they supped, Gonzaga pleaded toothache, and with
      Valentina&rsquo;s leave he quitted the table at the very outset of the meal.
      Peppe rose to follow him, but as he reached the door, his natural enemy,
      the friar&mdash;ever anxious to thwart him where he could&mdash;caught him
      by the nape of the neck, and flung him unceremoniously back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a toothache too, good-for-naught?&rdquo; quoth the frate. &ldquo;Stay you
      here and help me to wait upon the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, good Fra Domenico,&rdquo; the fool whispered, in a voice so earnest
      that the monk left his way clear. But Valentina&rsquo;s voice now bade him stay
      with them, and so his opportunity was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved about the room a very dispirited, moody fool with no quip for
      anyone, for his thoughts were all on Gonzaga and the treason that he was
      sure he was hatching. Yet faithful to Francesco, who sat all unconcerned,
      and not wishing to alarm Valentina, he choked back the warning that rose
      to his lips, seeking to convince himself that his fears sprang perhaps
      from an excess of suspicion. Had he known how well-founded indeed they
      were he might have practised less self-restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      For whilst he moved sullenly about the room, assisting Fra Domenico with
      the dishes and platters, Gonzaga paced the ramparts beside Cappoccio, who
      was on sentry duty on the north wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      His business called for no great diplomacy, nor did Gonzaga employ much.
      He bluntly told Cappoccio that he and his comrades had allowed Messer
      Francesco&rsquo;s glib tongue to befool them that morning, and that the
      assurances Francesco had given them were not worthy of an intelligent
      man&rsquo;s consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Cappoccio,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;that to remain here and protract this
      hopeless resistance will cost you your life at the unsavoury hands of the
      hangman. You see I am frank with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now for all that what Gonzaga told him might sort excellently well with
      the ideas he had himself entertained, Cappoccio was of a suspicious
      nature, and his suspicions whispered to him now that Gonzaga was actuated
      by some purpose he could not gauge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, and leaning with both hands upon his partisan, he sought
      to make out the courtier&rsquo;s features in the dim light of the rising moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; he asked, and in his voice sounded the surprise with which
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s odd speech had filled him, &ldquo;that we are foolish to have listened
      to Messer Francesco, and that we should be better advised to march out of
      Roccaleone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; he insisted, his surprise increasing, &ldquo;do you urge such a
      course upon us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Cappoccio,&rdquo; was the plausible reply, &ldquo;like yourselves, I was
      lured into this business by insidious misrepresentations. The assurances
      that I gave Fortemani, and with which he enrolled you into his service,
      were those that had been given to me. I did not bargain with such a death
      as awaits us here, and I frankly tell you that I have no stomach for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; murmured Cappoccio, sagely wagging his head, and
      there was a shrewd insolence in his tone and manner. &ldquo;When we leave
      Roccaleone you come with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you not say these things to Fortemani?&rdquo; questioned Cappoccio,
      still doubting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortemani!&rdquo; echoed Gonzaga. &ldquo;By the Host, no! The man is bewitched by
      that plausible rogue, Francesco. Far from resenting the fellow&rsquo;s treatment
      of him, he follows and obeys his every word, like the mean-spirited dog
      that he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Cappoccio sought to scrutinise Gonzaga&rsquo;s face. But the light was
      indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you dealing with me fairly?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Or does some deeper purpose
      lie under your wish that we should rebel against the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; answered Gonzaga, &ldquo;do you but wait until Gian Maria&rsquo;s herald
      comes for his answer in the morning. Then you will learn again the terms
      on which your lives are offered you. Do nothing until then. But when you
      hear yourselves threatened with the rope and the wheel, bethink you of
      what course you will be best advised in pursuing. You ask me what purpose
      inspires me. I have already told you&mdash;for I am as open as the
      daylight with you&mdash;that I am inspired by the purpose of saving my own
      neck. Is not that purpose enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A laugh of such understanding as would have set a better man on fire with
      indignation was the answer he received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, it is more than enough. To-morrow, then, my comrades and I
      march out of Roccaleone. Count upon that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do not accept my word. Wait until the herald comes again. Do nothing
      until you have heard the terms he brings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, assuredly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do not let it transpire among your fellows that it is I who have
      suggested this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no. I&rsquo;ll keep your secret,&rdquo; laughed the bravo offensively,
      shouldering his partisan and resuming his sentinel&rsquo;s pacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga sought his bed. A fierce joy consumed him at having so
      consummately planned Valentina&rsquo;s ruin, yet he did not wish to face her
      again that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when on the morrow the herald wound his horn again beneath the castle
      walls, Gonzaga was prominent in the little group that attended Monna
      Valentina. The Count of Aquila was superintending the work to which he had
      set a half-score of men. With a great show, and as much noise as possible&mdash;by
      which Francesco intended that the herald should be impressed&mdash;they
      were rolling forward four small culverins and some three cannons of larger
      calibre, and planting them so that they made a menacing show in the
      crenels of the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst watching and directing the men, he kept his ears open for the
      message, and he heard the herald again recite the terms on which the
      garrison might surrender, and again the threat to hang every man from the
      castle-walls if they compelled him to reduce them by force of arms. He
      brought his message to an end by announcing that in his extreme clemency
      Gian Maria accorded them another half-hour&rsquo;s grace in which to resolve
      themselves upon their course. Should the end of that time still find them
      obstinate, the bombardment would commence. Such was the message that in
      another of his arrow-borne letters Gonzaga had suggested Gian Maria should
      send.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Francesco who stepped forward to reply. He had been stooping over
      one of the guns, as if to assure himself of the accuracy of its aim, and
      as he rose he pronounced himself satisfied in a voice loud enough for the
      herald&rsquo;s hearing. Then he advanced to Valentina&rsquo;s side, and whilst he
      stood there delivering his answer he never noticed the silent departure of
      the men from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell his Highness of Babbiano,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that he reminds us
      of the boy in the fable who cried &lsquo;Wolf!&rsquo; too often. Tell him, sir, that
      his threats leave this garrison as unmoved as do his promises. If so be
      that he intends in truth to bombard us, let him begin forthwith. We are
      ready for him, as you perceive. Maybe he did not suppose us equipped with
      cannon; but there they stand. Those guns are trained upon his camp, and
      the first shot he fires upon us shall be a signal for such a reply as he
      little dreams of. Tell him, too, that we expect no quarter, and will yield
      none. We are unwilling for bloodshed, but if he drives us to it and
      executes his purpose of employing cannon, then the consequences be upon
      his own head. Bear him that answer, and tell him to send you no more with
      empty threats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The herald bowed upon the withers of his horse. The arrogance, the cold
      imperiousness of the message struck him dumb with amazement. Amazement was
      his, too, that Roccaleone should be armed with cannon, as with his own
      eyes he saw. That those guns were empty he could not guess, nor could Gian
      Maria when he heard a message that filled him with rage, and would have
      filled him with dismay, but that he counted upon the mutiny which Gonzaga
      had pledged himself to stir up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the herald was riding away a gruff laugh broke from Fortemani, who
      stood behind the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina turned to Francesco with eyes that beamed admiration and a
      singular tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what had I done without you, Messer Francesco?&rdquo; she cried, for surely
      the twentieth time since his coming. &ldquo;I tremble to think how things had
      gone without your wit and valour to assist me.&rdquo; She never noticed the
      malicious smile that trembled on Gonzaga&rsquo;s pretty face. &ldquo;Where did you
      find the powder?&rdquo; she asked innocently, for her mind had not yet caught
      that humour of the situation that had drawn a laugh from Fortemani.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found none,&rdquo; answered Francesco, smiling from the shadow of his helm.
      &ldquo;My threats&rdquo;&mdash;and he waved his hand in the direction of that
      formidable array of guns&mdash;&ldquo;are as empty as Gian Maria&rsquo;s. Yet I think
      they will impress him more than his do us. I will answer for it, Madonna,
      that they deter him from bombarding us&mdash;if so be that he ever
      intended to. So let us go and break our fast with a glad courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those guns are empty?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;And you could talk so boldly and
      threaten so defiantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mirth crept now into her face, and thrust back the alarm, a little of
      which had peeped from her eyes even as she was extolling Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he cried joyously. &ldquo;You are smiling now, Madonna. Nor have you
      cause for aught else. Shall we descend? This early morning work has given
      me the hunger of a wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to go with him, and in that moment, Peppe, his owlish face
      spread over with alarm, dashed up the steps from the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna!&rdquo; he gasped, breathless. &ldquo;Messer Francesco! The men&mdash;Cappoccio&mdash;&mdash;
      He is haranguing them. He&mdash;is inciting them to treachery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, in gasps, he got out his tale, which swept the mirth again from
      Valentina&rsquo;s eyes, and painted very white her cheek. Strong and brave
      though she was, she felt her senses swimming at that sudden revulsion from
      confidence to fear. Was all indeed ended at the very moment when hope had
      reached its high meridian?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are faint, Madonna; lean on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Gonzaga who spoke. But beyond the fact that the words had been
      uttered, she realised nothing. She saw an arm advanced, and she took it.
      Then she dragged Gonzaga with her to the side overlooking the courtyard,
      that with her own eyes she might have evidence of what was toward.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard an oath&mdash;a vigorous, wicked oath&mdash;from Francesco,
      followed by a command, sharp and rasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the armoury yonder, Peppe! Fetch me a two-handed sword&mdash;the
      stoutest you can find. Ercole, come with me. Gonzaga&mdash;&mdash; Nay,
      you had best stay here. See to Monna Valentina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped to her side now, and rapidly surveyed the surging scene below,
      where Cappoccio was still addressing the men. At sight of Francesco, they
      raised a fierce yell, as might a pack of dogs that have sighted their
      quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the gates!&rdquo; was the shout. &ldquo;Down the draw­bridge! We accept the terms
      of Gian Maria. We will not die like rats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, but you shall, if I so will it!&rdquo; snarled Francesco through his
      set teeth. Then turning his head in a fever of impatience &ldquo;Peppe,&rdquo; he
      shouted, &ldquo;will you never bring that sword?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fool came up at that moment, staggering under the weight of a great,
      double-edged two-hander, equipped with lugs, and measuring a good six feet
      from point to pummel. Francesco caught it from him, and bending, he
      muttered a swift order in Peppino&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...In the box that stands upon the table in my chamber,&rdquo; Gonzaga
      overheard him say. &ldquo;Now go, and bring it to me in the yard. Speed you,
      Peppino!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of understanding flashed up from the hunchback&rsquo;s eyes, and as he
      departed at a run Francesco hoisted the mighty sword to his shoulder as
      though its weight were that of a feather. In that instant Valentina&rsquo;s
      white hand was laid upon the brassart that steeled his fore-arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; she questioned, in a whisper, her eyes dilating with
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stem the treachery of that rabble,&rdquo; he answered shortly. &ldquo;Stay you here,
      Madonna. Fortemani and I will pacify them&mdash;or make an end of them.&rdquo;
       And so grimly did he say it that Gonzaga believed it to lie within his
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are mad!&rdquo; she cried, and the fear in her eyes increased. &ldquo;What
      can you do against twenty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What God pleases,&rdquo; he answered, and for a second put the ferocity from
      his heart that he might smile reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will be killed,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t go, don&rsquo;t go! Let them
      have their way, Messer Francesco. Let Gian Maria invest the castle. I care
      not, so that you do not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, and the tale it told of sweet anxiety for his fate overruling
      everything else in that moment&mdash;even her horror of Gian Maria&mdash;quickened
      his blood to the pace of ecstasy. He was taken by a wild longing to catch
      her in his arms&mdash;this lady hitherto so brave and daunted now by the
      fear of his peril only. Every fibre of his being urged him to gather her
      to his breast, whilst he poured courage and comfort into her ear. He
      fainted almost with desire to kiss those tender eyes, upturned to his in
      her piteous pleading that he should not endanger his own life. But
      suppressing all, he only smiled, though very tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be brave, Madonna, and trust in me a little. Have I failed you yet? Need
      you then fear that I shall fail you now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she seemed to gather courage. The words reawakened her confidence
      in his splendid strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall laugh over this when we break our fast,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come,
      Ercole!&rdquo; And without waiting for more, he leapt down the steps with an
      agility surprising in one so heavily armed as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were no more than in time. As they gained the courtyard the men came
      sweeping along towards the gates, their voices raucous and threatening.
      They were full of assurance. All hell they thought could not have hindered
      them, and yet at sight of that tall figure, bright as an angel, in his
      panoply of glittering steel, with that great sword poised on his left
      shoulder, some of the impetuousness seemed to fall from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still they advanced, Cappoccio&rsquo;s voice shouting encouragement. Almost were
      they within range of that lengthy sword, when of a sudden it flashed from
      his shoulder, and swept a half-circle of dazzling light before their eyes.
      Round his head it went, and back again before them, handled as though it
      had been a whip, and bringing them, silent, to a standstill. He bore it
      back to his shoulder, and alert for the first movement, his blood on fire,
      and ready to slay a man or two should the example become necessary, he
      addressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what awaits you if you persist in this,&rdquo; he said, in a
      dangerously quiet voice. &ldquo;Have you no shame, you herd of cowardly animals!
      You are loud-voiced enough where treason to the hand that pays you is in
      question; but there, it seems, your valour ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to them now in burning words. He recapitulated the arguments
      which yesterday he had made use of to quell the mutinous spirit of
      Cappoccio. He assured them that Gian Maria threatened more than he could
      accomplish; and so, perhaps, more than he would fulfil if they were so
      foolish as to place themselves in his power. Their safety, he pointed out
      to them, lay here, behind these walls. The siege could not long endure.
      They had a stout ally in Caesar Borgia, and he was marching upon Babbiano
      by then, so that Gian Maria must get him home perforce ere long. Their pay
      was good, he reminded them, and if the siege were soon raised they should
      be well rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gian Maria threatens to hang you when he captures Roccaleone. But even
      should he capture it, do you think he would be allowed to carry out so
      inhuman a threat? You are mercenaries, after all, in the pay of Monna
      Valentina, on whom and her captains the blame must fall. This is Urbino,
      not Babbiano, and Gian Maria is not master here. Do you think the noble
      and magnanimous Guidobaldo would let you hang? Have you so poor an opinion
      of your Duke? Fools! You are as safe from violence as are those ladies in
      the gallery up there. For Guidobaldo would no more think of harming you
      than of permitting harm to come to them. If any hanging there is it will
      be for me, and perhaps for Messer Gonzaga who hired you. Yet, do I talk of
      throwing down my arms? What think you holds me here? Interest&mdash;just
      as interest holds you&mdash;and if I think the risk worth taking, why
      should not you? Are you so tame and so poor-spirited that a threat is to
      vanquish you? Will you become a byword in Italy, and when men speak of
      cowardice, will you have them say: &lsquo;Craven as Monna Valentina&rsquo;s
      garrison&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this strain he talked to them, now smiting hard with his scorn, now
      cajoling them with his assurances, and breeding confidence anew in their
      shaken spirits. It was a thing that went afterwards to the making of an
      epic that was sung from Calabria to Piedmont, how this brave knight, by
      his words, by the power of his will and the might of his presence, curbed
      and subdued that turbulent score of rebellious hinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the wall above Valentina watched him, her eyes sparkling with
      tears that had not their source in sorrow nor yet in fear, for she knew
      that he must prevail. How could it be else with one so dauntless?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus thought she now. But in the moment of his going, fear had chilled her
      to the heart, and when she first saw him take his stand before them, she
      had turned half-distraught, and begged Gonzaga not to linger at her side,
      but to go lend what aid he could to that brave knight who stood so sorely
      in need of it. And Gonzaga had smiled a smile as pale as January sunshine,
      and his soft blue eyes had hardened in their glance. Not weakness now was
      it that held him there, well out of the dangerous turmoil. For he felt
      that had he possessed the strength of Hercules, and the courage of
      Achilles, he would not in that instant have moved a step to Francesco&rsquo;s
      aid. And as much he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, Madonna?&rdquo; he had returned coldly. &ldquo;Why should I raise a
      hand to help the man whom you prefer to me? Why should I draw sword in the
      cause of this fortress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with troubled eyes. &ldquo;What are you saying, my good
      Gonzaga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;your good Gonzaga!&rdquo; he mocked her bitterly. &ldquo;Your lap-dog, your
      lute-thrummer; but not man enough to be your captain; not man enough to
      earn a thought that is kinder than any earned by Peppe or your hounds. I
      may endanger my neck to serve you, to bring you hither to a place of
      safety from Gian Maria&rsquo;s persecution, and be cast aside for one who, it
      happens, has a little more knowledge of this coarse trade of arms. Cast me
      aside if you will,&rdquo; he pursued, with increasing bitterness, &ldquo;but having
      done so, do not ask me to serve you again. Let Messer Francesco fight it
      out&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Gonzaga!&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Let me hear what he is saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her tone told the courtier that his words had been lost upon the
      morning air. Engrossed in the scene below she had not so much as listened
      to his bitter tirade. For now Francesco was behaving oddly. The fool was
      returned from the errand on which he had been despatched, and Francesco
      called him to his side. Lowering his sword he received a paper from
      Peppe&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burning with indignation at having gone unheeded, Gonzaga stood gnawing
      his lip, whilst Valentina craned forward to catch Francesco&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have here a proof,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;of what I tell you; proof of how little
      Gian Maria is prepared to carry out his threats of cannon. It is that
      fellow Cappoccio has seduced you with his talk. And you, like the sheep
      you are, let yourselves be driven by his foul tongue. Now listen to the
      bribe that Gian Maria offers to one within these walls if he can contrive
      a means to deliver Roccaleone into his hands.&rdquo; And to Gonzaga&rsquo;s paralysing
      consternation, he heard Francesco read the letter with which Gian Maria
      had answered his proposed betrayal of the fortress. He went white with
      fear and he leant against the low wall to steady the tell-tale trembling
      that had seized him. Then Francesco&rsquo;s voice, scornful and confident,
      floated up to his ears. &ldquo;I ask you, my friends, would his Highness of
      Babbiano be disposed to the payment of a thousand gold florins if by
      bombardment he thought to break a way into Roccaleone? This letter was
      written yesterday. Since then we have made a brave display of cannon
      ourselves; and if yesterday he dared not fire, think you he will to-day?
      But here, assure yourselves, if there is one amongst you that can read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out the letter to them. Cappoccio took it, and calling one
      Aventano, he held it out in his turn. This Aventano, a youth who had been
      partly educated for the Church, but had fallen from that lofty purpose,
      now stood forward and took the letter. He scrutinised it, read it aloud,
      and pronounced it genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom is it addressed to?&rdquo; demanded Cappoccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; cried Francesco. &ldquo;What need for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let be,&rdquo; Cappoccio answered, almost fiercely. &ldquo;If you would have us
      remain in Roccaleone, let be. Aventano, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Messer Romeo Gonzaga,&rdquo; answered the youth, in a voice of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      So evil a light leapt to Cappoccio&rsquo;s eye that Francesco carried his free
      hand to the sword which he had lowered. But Cappoccio only looked up at
      Gonzaga, and grinned malevolently. It had penetrated his dull wits that he
      had been the tool of a judas, who sought to sell the castle for a thousand
      florins. Further than that Cappoccio did not see; nor was he very
      resentful, and his grin was rather of mockery than of anger. He was
      troubled by no lofty notions of honour that should cause him to see in
      this deed of Gonzaga&rsquo;s anything more than such a trickster&rsquo;s act as it is
      always agreeable to foil. And then, to the others, who knew naught of what
      was passing in Cappoccio&rsquo;s mind, he did a mighty strange thing. From being
      the one to instigate them to treachery and mutiny, he was the one now to
      raise his voice in a stout argument of loyalty. He agreed with all that
      Messer Francesco had said, and he, for one, ranged himself on Messer
      Francesco&rsquo;s side to defend the gates from any traitors who sought to open
      them to Gian Maria Sforza.
    </p>
    <p>
      His defection from the cause of mutiny was the signal for the utter
      abandoning of that cause itself, and another stout ally came opportunely
      to weigh in Francesco&rsquo;s favour was the fact that the half-hour of grace
      was now elapsed, and Gian Maria&rsquo;s guns continued silent. He drew their
      attention to the fact with a laugh, and bade them go in peace, adding the
      fresh assurance that those guns would not speak that day, nor the next,
      nor indeed ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly conquered by Francesco and&mdash;perhaps even more&mdash;by his
      unexpected ally, Cappoccio, they slunk shamefacedly away to the food and
      drink that he bade them seek at Fra Domenico&rsquo;s hands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE LOVERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came that letter to your hands?&rdquo; Valentina asked Gonzaga, when
      presently they stood together in the courtyard, whither the courtier had
      followed her when she descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrapped round an arbalest-bolt that fell on the ramparts yesterday whilst
      I was walking there alone,&rdquo; returned Gonzaga coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had by now regained his composure. He saw that he stood in deadly
      peril, and the very fear that possessed him seemed, by an odd paradox, to
      lend him the strength to play his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina eyed him with a something of mistrust in her glance. But on
      Francesco&rsquo;s clear countenance no shadow of suspicion showed. His eyes
      almost smiled as he asked Gonzaga:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not bear it to Monna Valentina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush reddened the courtier&rsquo;s cheeks. He shrugged his shoulders
      impatiently, and in a voice that choked with anger he delivered his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, sir, who seem bred in camps and reared in guard-rooms, the
      fulness of this insult offered me by Gian Maria may not be apparent. It
      may not be yours to perceive that the very contact of that letter soiled
      my hands, that it shamed me unutterably to think that that loutish Duke
      should have deemed me a target for such a shaft. It were idle, therefore,
      to seek to make you understand how little I could bear to submit to the
      further shame of allowing another to see the affront that I was powerless
      to avenge. I did, sir, with that letter the only thing conceivable. I
      crumpled it in my hand and cast it from me, just as I sought to cast its
      contents from my mind. But your watchful spies, Ser Francesco, bore it to
      you, and if my shame has been paraded before the eyes of that rabble
      soldiery, at least it has served the purpose of saving Monna Valentina. To
      do that, I would, if the need arose, immolate more than the pride that
      caused me to be silent on the matter of this communication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with such heat of sincerity that he convinced both Francesco and
      Valentina, and the lady&rsquo;s eyes took on a softer expression as she surveyed
      Gonzaga&mdash;this poor Gonzaga whom, her heart told her, she had sorely
      wronged in thought. Francesco, ever generous, took his passionate
      utterances in excellent part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga, I understand your scruples. You do me wrong to think that
      I should fail in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He checked the suggestion he was on the point of renewing that,
      nevertheless, Gonzaga would have been better advised to have laid that
      letter at once before Monna Valentina. Instead, he dismissed the subject
      with a laugh, and proposed that they should break their fast so soon as he
      had put off his harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to do so, whilst Valentina bent her steps towards the dining-room,
      attended by Gonzaga, to whom she now sought to make amends for her
      suspicions by an almost excessive friendliness of bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one whom Gonzaga&rsquo;s high-sounding words in connection with
      that letter had left cold. This was Peppe, that most wise of fools. He
      hastened after Francesco, and while the knight was disarming he came to
      voice his suspicions. But Francesco drove him out with impatience, and
      Peppe went sorrowing and swearing that the wisdom of the fool was truly
      better than the folly of the wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout that day Gonzaga hardly stirred from Valentina&rsquo;s side. He
      talked with her in the morning at great length and upon subjects poetical
      or erudite, by which he meant to display his vast mental superiority over
      the swashbuckling Francesco. In the evening, when the heat of the day was
      spent, and whilst that same Messer Francesco was at some defensive
      measures on the walls, Gonzaga played at bowls with Valentina and her
      ladies&mdash;the latter having now recovered from the panic to which
      earlier they had been a prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning Gonzaga had stood at bay, seeing his plans crumble. That
      evening, after the day spent in Valentina&rsquo;s company&mdash;and she so sweet
      and kind to him&mdash;he began to take heart of grace once more, and his
      volatile mind whispered to his soul the hope that, after all, things might
      well be as he had first intended, if he but played his cards adroitly, and
      did not mar his chances by the precipitancy that had once gone near to
      losing him. His purpose gathered strength from a message that came that
      evening from Gian Maria, who was by then assured that Gonzaga&rsquo;s plan had
      failed. He sent word that, being unwilling to provoke the bloodshed
      threatened by the reckless madman who called himself Monna Valentina&rsquo;s
      Provost, he would delay the bombardment, hoping that in the meantime
      hunger would beget in that rebellious garrison a more submissive mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco read the message to Madonna&rsquo;s soldiers, and they received it
      joyously. Their confidence in him increased a hundredfold by this proof of
      the accuracy of his foresight. They were a gay company at supper in
      consequence, and gayest of all was Messer Gonzaga, most bravely dressed in
      a purple suit of taby silk to honour so portentous an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco was the first to quit the table, craving Monna Valentina&rsquo;s leave
      to be about some duty that took him to the walls. She let him go, and
      afterwards sat pensive, nor heeded now Romeo&rsquo;s light chatter, nor yet the
      sonnet of Petrarca that presently he sang the company. Her thoughts were
      all with him that had left the board. Scarcely a word had she exchanged
      with Francesco since that delirious moment when they had looked into each
      other&rsquo;s eyes upon the ramparts, and seen the secret that each was keeping
      from the other. Why had he not come to her? she asked herself. And then
      she bethought her of how Gonzaga had all day long been glued to her side,
      and she realised, too, that it was she had shunned Francesco&rsquo;s company,
      grown of a sudden strangely shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But greater than her shyness was now her desire to be near him, and to
      hear his voice; to have him look again upon her as he had looked that
      morning, when in terror for him she had sought to dissuade him from
      opposing the craven impulse of her men-at-arms. A woman of mature age, or
      one riper in experience, would have waited for him to seek her out. But
      Valentina, in her sweet naturalness, thought never of subterfuge or of
      dalliant wiles. She rose quietly from the table ere Gonzaga&rsquo;s song was
      done, and as quietly she slipped from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fine night, the air heavy with the vernal scent of fertile lands,
      and the deep cobalt of the heavens a glittering, star-flecked dome in a
      lighter space of which floated the half-disk of the growing moon. Such a
      moon, she bethought her, as she had looked at with thoughts of him, the
      night after their brief meeting at Acquasparta. She had gained that north
      rampart on which he had announced that duty took him, and yonder she saw a
      man&mdash;-the only tenant of the wall&mdash;leaning upon the embattled
      parapet, looking down at the lights of Gian Maria&rsquo;s camp. He was
      bareheaded, and by the gold coif that gleamed in his hair she knew him.
      Softly she stole up behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we dream here, Messer Francesco?&rdquo; she asked him, as she reached his
      side, and there was laughter running through her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started round at the sound of her voice, then he laughed too, softly
      and gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a night for dreams, and I was dreaming indeed. But you have
      scattered them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You grieve me,&rdquo; she rallied him. &ldquo;For assuredly they were pleasant,
      since, to come here and indulge them, you left&mdash;us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye&mdash;they were pleasant,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And yet, they were fraught
      with a certain sadness, but idle as is the stuff of dreams. They were
      yours to dispel, for they were of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; she questioned, her heart-beats quickening and bringing to her
      cheeks a flush that she thanked the night for concealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madonna&mdash;of you and our first meeting in the woods at
      Acquasparta. Do you recall it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, I do,&rdquo; she murmured fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you recall how I then swore myself your knight and ever your
      champion? Little did we dream how the honour that I sighed for was to be
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made him no answer, her mind harking back to that first meeting on
      which so often and so fondly she had pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking, too,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;of that man Gian Maria in the
      plain yonder, and of this shameful siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you have no misgivings?&rdquo; she faltered, for his words had
      disappointed her a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Misgivings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For being here with me. For being implicated in what they call my
      rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly, his eyes upon the silver gleam of waters below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My misgivings are all for the time when this siege shall be ended; when
      you and I shall have gone each our separate way,&rdquo; he answered boldly. He
      turned to face her now, and his voice rang a little tense. &ldquo;But for being
      here to guide this fine resistance and lend you the little aid I can&mdash;&mdash;
      No, no, I have no misgiving for that. It is the dearest frolic ever my
      soldiering led me into. I came to Roccaleone with a message of warning;
      but underneath, deep down in my heart, I bore the hope that mine should be
      more than a messenger&rsquo;s part; that mine it might be to remain by you and
      do such work as I am doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without you they would have forced me by now to surrender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they would. But while I am here I do not think they will. I burn
      for news of Babbiano. If I could but tell what is happening there I might
      cheer you with the assurance that this siege can last but a few days
      longer. Gian Maria must get him home or submit to the loss of his throne.
      And if he loses that your uncle would no longer support so strenuously his
      suit with you. To you, Madonna, this must be a cheering thought. To me&mdash;alas!
      Why should I hope for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking away now into the night, but his voice quivered with the
      emotion that was in him. She was silent, and emboldened perhaps by that
      silence of hers, encouraged by the memory of what he had seen that morning
      reflected in her eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I would it might be mine to cut a road for you
      through that besieging camp, and bear you away to some blessed place where
      there are neither courts nor princes. But since this may not be, Madonna
      mia, I would that this siege might last for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;was it the night breeze faintly stirring through his hair
      that mocked him with the whisper, &ldquo;So indeed would I?&rdquo; He turned to her,
      his hand, brown and nervous, fell upon hers, ivory-white, where it rested
      on the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valentina!&rdquo; he cried, his voice no louder than a whisper, his eyes
      ardently seeking her averted ones. And then, as suddenly as it had leapt
      up, was the fire in his glance extinguished. He withdrew his hand from
      hers, he sighed, and shifted his gaze to the camp once more. &ldquo;Forgive,
      forget, Madonna,&rdquo; he murmured bitterly, &ldquo;that which in my madness I have
      presumed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silent she stood for a long moment; then she edged nearer to him, and her
      voice murmured back: &ldquo;What if I account it no presumption?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gasp he swung round to face her, and they stood very close, glance
      holding glance, and hers the less timid of the two. They thus remained for
      a little space. Then shaking his head and speaking with an infinite
      sadness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were better that you did, Madonna,&rdquo; he made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better? But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am no duke, Madonna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what of that?&rdquo; she cried, to add with scorn: &ldquo;Out yonder sits a duke.
      Oh, sir, how shall I account presumptuous in you the very words that I
      would hear? What does your rank signify to me? I know you for the truest
      knight, the noblest gentleman, and the most valiant friend that ever came
      to the aid of distressed maiden. Do you forget the very principles that
      have led me to make this resistance? That I am a woman, and ask of life no
      more than is a woman&rsquo;s due&mdash;and no less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There she stopped; again the blood suffused her cheeks as she bethought
      her of how fast she talked, and of how bold her words might sound. She
      turned slightly from him, and leant now upon the parapet, gazing out into
      the night. And as she stood thus, a very ardent voice it was that
      whispered in her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valentina, by my soul, I love you!&rdquo; And there that whisper, which filled
      her with an ecstasy that was almost painful in its poignancy, ended
      sharply as if throttled. Again his hand sought hers, which was yielded to
      him as she would have yielded her whole life at his sweet bidding, and now
      his voice came less passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why delude ourselves with cruel hopes, my Valentina?&rdquo; he was saying.
      &ldquo;There is the future. There is the time when this siege shall be done
      with, and when, Gian Maria having got him home, you will be free to
      depart. Whither will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him as if she did not understand the question, and her eyes
      were troubled, although in such light as there was he could scarce see
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go whither you bid me. Where else have I to go?&rdquo; she added, with a
      note of bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. Her answer was so far from what he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your uncle&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What duty do I owe to him? Oh, I have thought of it, and until&mdash;until
      this morning, it seemed that a convent must be my ultimate refuge. I have
      spent most of my young life at Santa Sofia, and the little that I have
      seen of the world at my uncle&rsquo;s court scarce invites me to see more of it.
      The Mother Abbess loved me a little. She would take me back, unless&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off and looked at him, and before that look of absolute and
      sweet surrender his senses swam. That she was niece to the Duke of Urbino
      he remembered no more than that he was Count of Aquila, well-born, but of
      none too rich estate, and certainly no more a match for her in
      Guidobaldo&rsquo;s eyes than if he had been the simple knight-errant that he
      seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved closer to her, his hands&mdash;as if obeying a bidding greater
      than his will, the bidding of that glance of hers, perhaps&mdash;took her
      by the shoulders, whilst his whole soul looked at her from his eyes. Then,
      with a stifled cry, he caught her to him. For a moment she lay, palpitant,
      within his arms, her tall, bronze head on a level with his chin, her heart
      beating against his heart. Stooping suddenly, he kissed her on the lips.
      She suffered it with an unresistance that invited. But when it was done,
      she gently put him from her; and he, obedient to her slightest wish,
      curbed the wild ardour of his mood, and set her free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anima mia!&rdquo; he cried rapturously. &ldquo;You are mine now, betide what may. Not
      Gian Maria nor all the dukes in Christendom shall take you from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She set her hand upon his lips to silence him, and he kissed the palm, so
      that laughing she drew back again. And now from laughter she passed to a
      great solemnity, and with arm outstretched towards the ducal camp: &ldquo;Win me
      a way through those lines,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and bear me away from Urbino&mdash;far
      away where Guidobaldo&rsquo;s power and the vengeance of Gian Maria may not
      follow us&mdash;and you shall have won me for your own. But until then,
      let there be a truce to&mdash;to this, between us. Here is a man&rsquo;s work to
      be done, and if I am weak as to-night, I may weaken you, and then we
      should both be undone. It is upon your strength I count, Franceschino mio,
      my true knight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have answered her. He had much to tell her&mdash;who and what he
      was. But she pointed to the head of the steps, where a man&rsquo;s figure
      loomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder comes the sentinel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Leave me now, dear Francesco. Go.
      It is growing late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed low before her, obedient ever, like the true knight he was, and
      took his leave of her, his soul on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina watched his retreating figure until it had vanished round the
      angle of the wall. Then with a profound sigh, that was as a prayer of
      thanksgiving for this great good that had come into her life, she leaned
      upon the parapet and looked out into the darkness, her cheeks flushed, her
      heart still beating high. She laughed softly to herself out of the pure
      happiness of her mood. The camp of Gian Maria became a subject for her
      scorn. What should his might avail whilst she had such a champion to
      defend her now and hereafter?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an irony in that siege on which her fancy fastened. By coming
      thus in arms against her Gian Maria sought to win her for his wife; yet
      all that he had accomplished was to place her in the arms of the one man
      whom she had learnt to love by virtue of this very siege. The mellow
      warmth of the night, the ambient perfume of the fields were well-sorted to
      her mood, and the faint breeze that breathed caressingly upon her cheek
      seemed to re-echo the melodies her heart was giving forth. In that hour
      those old grey walls of Roccaleone seemed to enclose for her a very
      paradise, and the snatch of an old love song stole softly from her parted
      lips. But like a paradise&mdash;alas!&mdash;it had its snake that crept up
      unheard behind her, and was presently hissing in her ear. And its voice
      was the voice of Romeo Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comforts me, Madonna, that there is one, at least, in Roccaleone has
      the heart to sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled out of her happy pensiveness by that smooth and now unutterably
      sinister voice, she turned to face its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the white gleam of his face and something of the anger that
      smouldered in his eye, and despite herself a thrill of alarm ran through
      her like a shudder. She looked beyond him to a spot where lately she had
      seen the sentry. There was no one there nor anywhere upon that wall. They
      were alone, and Messer Gonzaga looked singularly evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was a tense silence, broken only by the tumbling waters
      of the torrent-moat and the hoarse challenge of a sentry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chi va là?&rdquo; in
      Gian Maria&rsquo;s camp. Then she turned nervously, wondering how much he might
      have heard of what had passed between herself and Francesco, how much have
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she answered him, &ldquo;I left you singing below when I
      came away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;To wanton it here in the moonlight with that damned swashbuckler,
      that brigand, that kennel-bred beast of a sbirro!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gonzaga! You would dare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare?&rdquo; he mocked her, beside himself with passion. &ldquo;Is it you who speak
      of daring&mdash;you, the niece of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, a lady of the
      noble and illustrious house of Rovere, who cast yourself into the arms of
      a low-born vassal such as that, a masnadiero, a bandit, a bravo? And can
      you yet speak of daring, and take that tone with me, when shame should
      strike you either dead or dumb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gonzaga,&rdquo; she answered him, her face as white as his own, but her voice
      steady and hard with anger, &ldquo;leave me now&mdash;upon the instant, or I
      will have you flogged&mdash;flogged to the bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment he stared at her like a man dazed. Then he tossed his arms to
      Heaven, and letting them fall heavily to his sides, he shrugged his
      shoulders and laughed evilly. But of going he made no shift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call your men,&rdquo; he answered her, in a choking voice. &ldquo;Do your will on me.
      Flog me to the bone or to the death&mdash;let that be the reward of all
      that I have done, all that I have risked, all that I have sacrificed to
      serve you. It were of a piece with your other actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sought his in the gloom, her bosom heaving wildly in her
      endeavours to master herself before she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Gonzaga,&rdquo; said she at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not deny that you served me
      faithfully in the matter of my escape from Urbino&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why speak of it?&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;It was a service of which you but avail
      yourself until another offered on whom you might bestow your favour and
      the supreme command of your fortress. Why speak of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To show you that the service you allude to is now paid,&rdquo; she riposted
      sternly. &ldquo;By reproaching me you have taken payment, and by insulting me
      you have stamped out my gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most convenient logic yours,&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;I am cast aside like an
      outworn garment, and the garment is accounted paid for because through
      much hard usage it has come to look a little threadbare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now it entered her mind that perhaps there was some justice in what he
      said. Perhaps she had used him a little hardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Gonzaga,&rdquo; she said, and her tone was now a shade more
      gentle, &ldquo;that because you have served me you may affront me, and that
      knight who has served me, also, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what can such service as his compare with mine? What has he done that
      I have not done more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when the men rebelled here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Cite me not that. Body of God! it is his trade to lead such swine.
      He is one of themselves. But for the rest, what has such a man as this to
      lose by his share in your rebellion, compared with such a loss as mine
      must be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if things go ill, I take it he may lose his life,&rdquo; she answered, in
      a low voice. &ldquo;Can you lose more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If things go ill&mdash;yes. It may cost him dearly. But if they go well,
      and this siege is raised, he has nothing more to fear. Mine is a parlous
      case. However ends this siege, for me there will be no escape from the
      vengeance of Gian Maria and Guidobaldo. They know my share in it. They
      know that your action was helped by me, and that without me you could
      never have equipped yourself for such resistance. Whatever may betide you
      and this Ser Franceseo, for me there will be no escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath, then set him the obvious question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not consider it&mdash;did you not weigh these chances&mdash;before
      you embarked upon this business, before you, yourself, urged me to this
      step?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, did I,&rdquo; he answered sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why these complaints now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was singularly, madly frank with her in his reply. He told her that he
      had done it because he loved her, because she had given him signs that his
      love was not in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you signs?&rdquo; she interrupted him. &ldquo;Mother in Heaven! Recite these
      signs that I may know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not ever kind to me?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Did you not ever manifest a
      liking for my company? Were you not ever pleased that I should sing to you
      the songs that in your honour I had made? Was it not to me you turned in
      the hour of your need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See now how poor a thing you are, Gonzaga?&rdquo; she answered witheringly. &ldquo;A
      woman may not smile on you, may not give you a kind word, may not suffer
      you to sing to her, but you must conclude she is enamoured of you. And if
      I turned to you in my hour of need, as you remind me, needs that be a sign
      of my infatuation? Does every cavalier so think when a helpless woman
      turns to him in her distress? But even so,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;how should all
      that diminish the peril you now talk of? Even were your suit with me to
      prosper, would that make you any the less Romeo Gonzaga, the butt of the
      anger of my uncle and Gian Maria? Rather do I think that it should make
      you more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he disillusioned her. He did not scruple, in his angry mood, to lay
      before her his reasonings that as her husband he would be screened.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed aloud at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it is by such sophistries as these that your presumption came to
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That stung him. Quivering with the passion that obsessed him, he stepped
      close up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Madonna&mdash;why shall we account presumption in Romeo Gonzaga
      a suit that in a nameless adventurer we encourage?&rdquo; he asked, his voice
      thick and tremulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care,&rdquo; she bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A care of what?&rdquo; he flashed back. &ldquo;Answer me, Monna Valentina. Am I so
      base a man that by the very thought of love for you I must presume, whilst
      you can give yourself into the arms of this swashbuckling bravo, and take
      his kisses? Your reasoning sorts ill with your deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Craven!&rdquo; she answered him. &ldquo;Dog that you are!&rdquo; And before the blaze of
      passion in her eyes he recoiled, his courage faltering. She cropped her
      anger in mid-career, and in a dangerously calm voice she bade him see to
      it that by morning he was no longer in Roccaleone. &ldquo;Profit by the night,&rdquo;
       she counselled him, &ldquo;and escape the vigilance of Gian Maria as best you
      can. Here you shall not stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that a great fear took possession of him, putting to flight the last
      remnant of his anger. Nor fear alone was it, to do him full justice. It
      was also the realisation that if he would take payment from her for this
      treatment of him, if he would slake his vengeance, he must stay. One plan
      had failed him. But his mind was fertile, and he might devise another that
      might succeed and place Gian Maria in Roccaleone. Thus should he be amply
      venged. She was turning away, having pronounced his banishment, but he
      sprang after her, and upon his knees he now besought her piteously to hear
      him yet awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, regretting her already of her harshness, and thinking that
      perhaps in his jealousy he had been scarce responsible for what he had
      said, stood still to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that, not that, Madonna,&rdquo; he wailed, his tone suggesting the
      imminence of tears. &ldquo;Do not send me away. If die I must, let me die here
      at Roccaleone, helping the defence to my last breath. But do not cast me
      out to fall into the hands of Gian Maria. He will hang me for my share in
      this business. Do not requite me thus, Madonna. You owe me a little,
      surely, and if I was mad when I talked to you just now, it was love of you
      that drove me&mdash;love of you and suspicion of that man of whom none of
      us know anything. Madonna, be pitiful a little. Suffer me to remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at him, her mind swayed between pity and contempt. Then
      pity won the day in the wayward but ever gentle heart of Valentina. She
      bade him rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And go, Gonzaga. Get you to bed, and sleep you into a saner frame of
      mind. We will forget all this that you have said, so that you never speak
      of it again&mdash;nor of this love you say you bear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hypocrite caught the hem of her cloak, and bore it to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God keep your heart ever as pure and noble and forgiving,&rdquo; he
      murmured brokenly. &ldquo;I know how little I am deserving of your clemency. But
      I shall repay you, Madonna,&rdquo; he protested&mdash;and truly meant it, though
      not in the sense it seemed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE PENITENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week passed peacefully at Roccaleone; so peacefully that it was
      difficult to conceive that out there in the plain sat Gian Maria with his
      five-score men besieging them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This inaction fretted the Count of Aquila, as did the lack of news from
      Fanfulla; and he wondered vaguely what might be taking place at Babbiano
      that Gian Maria should be content to sit idly before them, as though he
      had months at his disposal in which to starve them into yielding. The
      mystery would have been dispelled had he known that he had Gonzaga to
      thank for this singular patience of Gian Maria&rsquo;s. For the courtier had
      found occasion to send another letter-carrying shaft into the Duke&rsquo;s camp,
      informing him of how and why the last plot had failed, and urging Gian
      Maria to wait and trust in him to devise a better scheme for delivering
      the castle into his power. He had promised boldly and confidently enough,
      and Gian Maria&mdash;facts showed&mdash;had trusted to that promise of
      his, and awaited its fulfilment. But tax his mind though he did
      incessantly, no inspiration came to him, no scheme suggested itself by
      which he might accomplish his treacherous purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He employed the time cunningly to win back Valentina&rsquo;s favour and
      confidence. On the morning after his stormy interview with Guidobaldo&rsquo;s
      niece, he had confessed himself to Fra Domenico, and approached the
      Sacrament. Every morning thereafter he appeared at Mass, and by the piety
      and fervour of his devotions became an example to all the others. Now this
      was not lost on Valentina, who was convent-bred, and in a measure devout.
      She read in this singular alteration of his ways the undoubtable
      indication of an altered character. That he had approached the Sacrament
      on the morning after his wild words to her, she took to mean that he
      repented him the viciousness of the animosity he had entertained that he
      continued so extremely devout thereafter she construed into meaning that
      his repentance was sincere and persistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she came to ask herself whether, indeed, he had not been as much
      sinned against as sinning, and she ended by assuring herself that in a
      measure the fault was hers. Seeing him so penitent, and concluding from it
      that he was not likely to transgress again, she readmitted him to her
      favour, and, little by little, the old friendly state was re-established
      and was the sounder, perhaps, by virtue of her confidence that after what
      had passed he would not again misunderstand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not, nor did he again allow his optimism and ever-ready vanity to
      cozen him with false hopes. He read her with exact precision, and whilst
      the reading but served to embitter him the more and render him more
      steadfast in his vengeful purpose, it, nevertheless, made him smile the
      more sweetly and fawn the more obsequiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not content with this, he did not limit his sycophancy to Valentina,
      but sought also by a smiling persistence to ingratiate himself with
      Francesco. No voice in Roccaleone&mdash;not even that of the bully Ercole&mdash;was
      raised more often or more enthusiastically to praise and glorify their
      Provost. Valentina, observing this, and accepting it as another sign of
      his contrition for the past and purpose of amendment for the future, grew
      yet more cordial towards him. He was not lacking in astuteness, this
      pretty Ser Romeo, nor in knowledge of a woman&rsquo;s heart, and the
      apprehension of the fact that there is no flattery she prefers to that
      which has for object the man she loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did Gonzaga conquer the confidence and esteem of all during that
      peaceful week. He seemed a changed man, and all save Peppe saw in this
      change a matter for increased trust and friendship towards him. But the
      astute fool looked on and pondered. Such transformations as these were not
      effected in a night. He was no believer in any human chrysalis that shall
      make of the grub of yesterday the butterfly of to-day. And so, in this
      fawning, smiling, subservient Gonzaga, he saw nothing but an object of
      mistrust, a fellow to be watched with the utmost vigilance. To this
      vigilance the hunchback applied himself with a zeal born of his cordial
      detestation of the courtier. But Gonzaga, aware of the fool&rsquo;s mistrust and
      watchfulness, contrived for once to elude him, and to get a letter to Gian
      Maria setting forth the ingenious plan he had hatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion had come to him that Sunday at Mass. On all sanctified days it
      was Monna Valentina&rsquo;s way to insist that the entire garrison, with the
      exception of one single sentinel&mdash;and this only at Francesco&rsquo;s very
      earnest urging&mdash;should attend the morning service. Like an
      inspiration it came to him that such a half-hour as that would be a most
      opportune season in which to throw open the gates of Roccaleone to the
      besiegers. The following Wednesday was the feast of Corpus Christi. Then
      would be his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling there, with head bent in ecstatic devotion, he matured his
      treacherous plan. The single sentry he could suborn, or else&mdash;if
      bribery failed&mdash;poniard. He realised that single-handed he might not
      lower the cumbrous drawbridge, nor would it be wise, even if possible, for
      the noise of it might give the alarm. But there was the postern. Gian
      Maria must construct him a light, portable bridge, and have it in
      readiness to span the moat and silently pour his soldiers into the castle
      through that little gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, the plot matured and every detail clear, he got him to his chamber
      and penned the letter that was to rejoice the heart of Gian Maria. He
      chose a favourable moment to despatch it, as he had despatched the former
      ones, tied about the quarrel of an arbalest, and he saw Gian Maria&rsquo;s
      signal&mdash;for which the letter had provided&mdash;that the plan would
      be adopted. Humming a gay measure, jubilant at the prospect of seeing
      himself so amply avenged, Gonzaga passed down and out into the castle
      gardens to join the ladies in their merry-making over a game of hoodman
      blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however much the Duke of Babbiano may have congratulated himself upon
      the ally he possessed in Gonzaga, and the cunning scheme the latter had
      devised for placing him in possession of Roccaleone, there came news to
      him on the morrow that caused him to rejoice a hundredfold more fervently.
      His subjects of Babbiano were in a condition approaching open rebellion,
      resulting from the disquieting rumours that Caesar Borgia was arming at
      Rome for a decent upon the Duchy, and the continued absence of Gian Maria
      in such a season, upon a wooing that they deemed ill-timed. A strong party
      had been formed, and the leaders had nailed upon the Palace gates a
      proclamation that, unless Gian Maria returned within three days to
      organise the defence of Babbiano, they would depose him and repair to
      Aquila to invite his cousin, Francesco del Falco&mdash;whose patriotism
      and military skill were known to all&mdash;to assume the crown of Babbiano
      and protect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the news, and upon reading the proclamation, which Alvari had brought
      with him, Gian Maria flew into one of those fits of rage that made his
      name a byword in Babbiano. Presently, however, he cooled. There was
      Gonzaga yonder, who had promised to admit him to Roccaleone on Wednesday.
      That left him time to first possess himself of his reluctant bride, and
      then ride hard to Babbiano, to arrive there before the expiry of the three
      days&rsquo; grace his subjects gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conferred with Guidobaldo, and urged that a priest should be in waiting
      to wed them so soon as he should have brought her out of the fortress.
      Upon that detail they were within an ace of quarrelling. Guidobaldo would
      not at first agree to such hasty nuptials; they were unfitting the dignity
      and the station of his niece, and if Gian Maria would wed her he must come
      to Urbino and let the ceremony be performed by a cardinal. Well was it
      then for Gian Maria that he mastered his wonted hastiness and curbed the
      hot, defiant retort that rose to his lips. Had he done so, an enduring
      rupture between them would probably have ensued; for Guidobaldo was not
      one to permit himself to be hectored, and, after all, he amply realised
      that Gian Maria had more need of him than he of Gian Maria. And this in
      that moment the Duke of Babbiano realised too, and realising it he set
      himself to plead where otherwise he might have demanded, to beg as a
      favour that which otherwise he might have commanded with a threat. And so
      he won Guidobaldo&mdash;although reluctant&mdash;to his wishes in the
      matter, and in his good-nature the Duke of Urbino consented to pocket the
      dignity that prompted him to see the ceremony performed with princely
      pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being settled, Gian Maria blessed Gonzaga who rendered it all
      possible, and came most opportunely to his aid where without him he should
      have been forced to resort to cannon and bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Gonzaga the only shadow of doubt that remained to mar the perfect
      certainty of his success lay in his appreciation of Francesco&rsquo;s daring
      character and resourceful mind, and now as if the gods were eager to
      favour him to the very last degree&mdash;a strange weapon to combat this
      was unexpectedly thrust into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that Alvari was not the only messenger who travelled that day
      to Roccaleone. There followed him by some hours, the Count of Aquila&rsquo;s
      servant, Zaccaria, who rode hard and reached the approaches of the castle
      by sunset. His destination being the fortress itself, he was forced to
      wait in the woods until night had fallen, and even then his mission was
      fraught with peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      It befell that somewhere near the second hour of night, the moon being
      overcast at the time&mdash;for there were threats of a storm in the sky&mdash;the
      sentinel on the eastern wall heard a sound of splashing in the moat below,
      accompanied by the stertorous breathing of a swimmer whose mouth is not
      well above water. He challenged the sound, but receiving no reply he
      turned to go and give the alarm, and ran into the arms of Gonzaga, who had
      come up to take the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Illustrious,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;there is someone swimming the moat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; cried Gonzaga, a hundred suspicions of Gian Maria running through
      his mind. &ldquo;Treachery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is what I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga took the man by the sleeve of his doublet, and drew him back to
      the parapet. They peered over, and from out of the blackness they were
      hailed by a faint &ldquo;Olá!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; demanded Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; came the answer softly. &ldquo;A messenger from Babbiano with
      letters for the Lord Count of Aquila. Throw me a rope, friends, before I
      drown in this trough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You rave, fool!&rdquo; answered him Gonzaga. &ldquo;We have no counts at Roccaleone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely, sir sentinel,&rdquo; replied the voice, &ldquo;my master, Messer Francesco
      del Falco, is here. Throw me a rope, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Fran&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Gonzaga. Then he made a noise like a man
      choking. It was as if a sudden light of revelation had flooded his brain.
      &ldquo;Get a rope,&rdquo; he harshly bade the sentry. &ldquo;In the armoury yard. Despatch,
      fool!&rdquo; he added sharply, now fearing interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the man was back, and the rope was lowered to the visitor
      below. A few seconds later Zaccaria stood on the ramparts of Roccaleone,
      the water dripping from his sodden garments, and gathering in a pool about
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said Gonzaga, leading the man towards the armoury tower, where
      a lanthorn was burning. By the light of it he surveyed the newcomer, and
      bade the sentry close the door and remain within call, without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zaccaria looked startled at the order. This was scarcely the reception he
      had expected after so imperilling his life to reach the castle with his
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my lord?&rdquo; he inquired, through teeth that chattered from the
      cold of his immersion, wondering vaguely who this very magnificent
      gentleman might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Messer Francesco del Falco your lord?&rdquo; asked Romeo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, sir. I have had the honour to serve him these ten years. I bring
      him letters from Messer Fanfulla degli Arcipreti. They are very urgent.
      Will you lead me to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very wet,&rdquo; murmured Gonzaga solicitously. &ldquo;You will take your
      death from cold, and the death of a man so brave as to have found a way
      through Gian Maria&rsquo;s lines were truly deplorable.&rdquo; He stepped to the door.
      &ldquo;Olá!&rdquo; he called to the sentry. &ldquo;Take this brave fellow up there and find
      him a change of raiment.&rdquo; He pointed to the upper chamber of the tower,
      where, indeed, such things were stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my letters, sir!&rdquo; cried Zaccaria impatiently. &ldquo;They are very urgent,
      and hours have I wasted already in waiting for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you can wait until you have changed your garments? Your life, I
      take it, is of more account than the loss of a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my orders from Messer degli Arcipreti were that I must not lose an
      instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, si, si!&rdquo; cried Gonzaga, with a show of good-tempered impatience.
      &ldquo;Give me the letters, then, and I will take them to the Count while you
      are stripping those wet clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zaccaria eyed him a moment in doubt. But he looked so harmless in his
      finery, and the expression of his comely face was so winning and honest,
      that the man&rsquo;s hesitancy faded as soon as it sprang up. Removing his cap,
      he drew from within the crown the letter, which he had placed there to
      keep dry. This package he now handed to Gonzaga, who, with a final word of
      instruction to the sentry touching the finding of raiment for the
      messenger, stepped out to go his errand. But outside the door he paused,
      and called the sentry to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a ducat for you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Do my bidding and you shall have
      more. Detain him in the tower till I return, and on no account let him be
      seen or heard by anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;But what if the captain comes and
      finds me absent from my post?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will provide for that. I will tell Messer Fortemani that I have
      employed you on a special matter, and ask him to replace you. You are
      dispensed sentry duty for to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man bowed, and quietly withdrew to attend to his prisoner, for in that
      light he now regarded Zaccaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga sought Fortemani in the guard-room below, and did as he had
      promised the sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; snapped Ercole, reddening, &ldquo;by whose authority have you done this?
      By what right do you send sentinels on missions of your own? Christo
      Santo! Is the castle to be invaded while you send my watchmen to fetch
      your comfit­box or a book of verses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Romeo, with an air of overwhelming
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take you and him that sent you!&rdquo; broke in the bully. &ldquo;The Messer
      Provost shall hear of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; cried Gonzaga, now passing from anger to alarm, and
      snatching the skirts of Fortemani&rsquo;s cloak as the captain was in the act of
      going out to execute his threat. &ldquo;Ser Ercole be reasonable, I beg of you.
      Are we to alarm the castle and disturb Monna Valentina over a trumpery
      affair such as this? Man, they will laugh at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; There was nothing Ercole relished less than to be laughed at. He
      pondered a moment, and it occurred to him that perhaps he was making much
      of nothing. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Aventano,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;take your partisan, and patrol the eastern
      rampart. There, Messer Gonzaga, I have obeyed your wishes; but Messer
      Francesco shall hear of it when he comes his rounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga left him. Francesco would not make his rounds for another hour,
      and by then it would not matter what Fortemani told him. In one way or
      another he would be able to account for his action.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the courtyard, and mounted the steps leading to his own
      chamber. Once there, he closed and barred the door. He kindled a light,
      and flinging the letter on the table, he sat and contemplated its exterior
      and the great red seal that gleamed in the yellow light of his taper.
    </p>
    <p>
      So! This knight-errant, this man whom he had accounted a low-born hind,
      was none other than the famous Count of Aquila, the well-beloved of the
      people of Babbiano, the beau-ideal of all military folk from Sicily to the
      Alps. And he had never suspected it! Dull-witted did he now account
      himself. Enough descriptions had he heard of that famous condottiero, that
      mirror of Italian chivalry. He might have known that there did not live
      two men of such commanding ways as he had seen instanced at Roccaleone.
      What was his object there? Was it love of Valentina, or was it&mdash;&mdash;?
      He paused, as in his mind he made a swift review of the politics of
      Babbiano. A sudden possibility occurred to him that made his eyes sparkle
      and his hands tremble with eagerness. Was this but a political scheme to
      undermine his cousin&rsquo;s throne, to which Gonzaga had heard it rumoured that
      Francesco del Falco was an aspirant? If it were so, what a vengeance would
      be his to unmask him! How it must humble Valentina! The letter lay before
      him. Within it the true facts would be disclosed. What did his friend
      Fanfulla write him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the letter up and made a close inspection of the seal. Then
      softly, quietly, slowly he drew his dagger. If his suspicions were
      unfounded, his dagger heated in the taper should afford him the means to
      conceal the fact that he had tampered with that missive. He slipped his
      blade under the seal, and worked it cautiously until it came up and set
      the letter open. He unfolded it, and as he read his eyes dilated. He
      seemed to crouch on his chair, and the hand that held the paper shook. He
      drew the candle nearer, and shading his eyes he read it again, word for
      word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR LORD COUNT,&mdash;I have delayed writing until the time when the
      signs I observed should have become more definite, as they have now done,
      so that I may delay no longer. This, then, goes by the hand of Zaccaria,
      to tell you that to-day has word been sent Gian Maria giving him three
      days in which to return to Babbiano, or to abandon all hope of his crown,
      of which the people will send the offer then to you at Aquila, where you
      are believed to be. So now, my dear lord, you have the tyrant at your
      mercy, tossed between Scylla and Charybdis. Yours it is to resolve how you
      will act; but I rejoice in being the one to send you word that your
      presence at Roccaleone and your stubborn defence of the fortress has not
      been vain, and that presently you are to reap the well-earned reward of
      it. The people have been stirred to this extreme action by the confusion
      prevailing here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News has reached us that Caesar Borgia is arming, at Rome, a condotta to
      invade Babbiano, and the people are exasperated at Gian Maria&rsquo;s continued
      absence in such a season. They are short-sighted in this, for they
      overlook the results that must attend the alliance with Urbino. May God
      protect and prosper your Excellency, whose most devoted servant is

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. A REVELATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francesco,&rdquo; said Valentina, and the name came from her lips as if it were
      an endearment, &ldquo;why that frowning, care­worn look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were in the dining-room alone, where the others had left them, and
      they were still seated at the table at which they had supped. Francesco
      raised his dark, thoughtful eyes, and as they lighted now on Valentina the
      thoughtfulness that was in them gave place to tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fretted by this lack of news,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;I would I knew what
      is being done in Babbiano. I had thought that ere now Caesar Borgia had
      stirred Gian Maria&rsquo;s subjects into some manner of action. I would I knew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and coming close to him, she stood with one hand resting upon
      his shoulder, her eyes smiling down upon his upturned face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall such a trifle fret you&mdash;you who professed a week ago that
      you would this siege might last for ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Account me not fickle, anima mia,&rdquo; he answered her, and he kissed the
      ivory fingers that rested on his shoulder. &ldquo;For that was before the world
      changed for me at the magic of your bidding. And so,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I
      would I knew what is toward at Babbiano!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why sigh over a wish so idle?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;By what means can news
      reach you here of the happenings of the world without?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered a moment, seeking words in which to answer her. A score of
      times during that week had he been on the point of disclosing himself, of
      telling her who and what he was. Yet ever had he hesitated, putting off
      that disclosure until the season should appear more fitting. This he now
      considered the present. She trusted him, and there was no reason to remain
      silent longer. Perhaps already he had delayed too long, and so he was
      about to speak when she started from his side, and crossed hastily to the
      window, alarmed by the sound of approaching steps. A second later the door
      opened, and Gonzaga appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment he hesitated in the doorway, looking from one to the other, and
      Francesco, lazily regarding him in his turn, noted that his cheeks were
      pale and that his eyes glittered like those of a man with the fever. Then
      he stepped forward, and, leaving the door open behind him, he advanced
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monna Valentina, I have something to communicate to you.&rdquo; His voice shook
      slightly. &ldquo;Messer&mdash;Francesco, will you give us leave?&rdquo; And his
      feverish eyes moved to the open door with an eloquence that asked no
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco rose slowly, endeavouring to repress his surprise and glanced
      across at Valentina, as if awaiting her confirmation or refusal of this
      request that he should leave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A communication for me?&rdquo; she marvelled, a slight frown drawing her brows
      together. &ldquo;Of what nature, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of a nature as important as it is private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her chin, and with a patient smile she seemed to beg of
      Francesco that he would suffer her to humour this mood of Gonzaga&rsquo;s. In
      quick obedience Francesco inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be in my chamber until the hour of my rounds, Madonna,&rdquo; he
      announced, and with that took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga attended him to the door, which he closed after him, and composing
      his features to an expression of sorrowing indignation, he came back and
      stood facing Valentina across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would to Heaven this communication I have to make
      to you came from other lips. In the light of what has passed&mdash;here at
      Roccaleone&mdash;through my folly&mdash;you&mdash;you may think my mission
      charged with vindictiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perplexity stared at him from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fill me with alarm, my good Gonzaga,&rdquo; she answered him, though
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas it has fallen to my unfortunate lot to do more than that. I have
      made the discovery of as foul a piece of treachery here in your fortress
      as ever traitor hatched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him more seriously now. The vehemence of his tone, and the
      suggestion of sorrow that ran through it and gave it so frank an accent,
      commanded her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; she echoed, in a low voice, her eyes dilating. &ldquo;And from
      whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment, then waving his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not sit, Madonna?&rdquo; he suggested nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically she seated herself at the table, her eyes ever on his face,
      alarm spreading in her heart, born of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated too,&rdquo; she bade him, &ldquo;and tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew up a chair, sat down opposite to her, and taking a deep breath:
      &ldquo;Heard you ever of the Count of Aquila?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were odd if I had not. The most valiant knight in Italy, fame dubs
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were intently on her face, and what he saw there satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how he stands with the people of Babbiano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that he is beloved of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know that he is a pretender to the throne of Babbiano? You
      will remember that he is cousin to Gian Maria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His relationship to Gian Maria I know. That he pretends to the throne of
      Babbiano I was not aware. But whither are we straying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not straying, Madonna,&rdquo; answered Gonzaga, &ldquo;we are making a
      straight line for the very heart and soul of this treachery I spoke of.
      Would you believe me if I told you that here, in Roccaleone, we have an
      agent of the Count of Aquila one who in the Count&rsquo;s interest is
      protracting this siege with the pretended aim of driving Gian Maria off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gonzaga&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, more than half guessing the drift of
      his explanation. But he interrupted her with unusual brusqueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Madonna,&rdquo; he cried, his eyes upon her face, his hand imperiously
      raised. &ldquo;Hear me out in patience. I am not talking idly. Of what I tell
      you I am armed with proof and witness. Such an agent of&mdash;of the
      Count&rsquo;s interests we have among us, and his true object in protracting
      this siege, and encouraging and aiding you in your resistance, is to
      outwear the patience of the people of Babbiano with Gian Maria, and drive
      them in the hour of their approaching peril from Caesar Borgia&rsquo;s armies to
      bestow the throne on Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where learnt you this foul lie?&rdquo; she asked him, her cheeks crimson, her
      eyes on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he said, in a patient voice, &ldquo;this that you call a lie is
      already an accomplished fact. I am not laying before you the fruits of
      idle speculation. I have upon me the most positive proof that such a
      result as was hoped for has already been reached. Gian Maria has received
      from his subjects a notification that unless he is in his capital within
      three days from this, they will invest the Lord of Aquila with the ducal
      crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, her anger well controlled, her voice calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is this proof? No, no; I don&rsquo;t need to see it. Whatever it is, what
      shall it prove to me? That your words, in so far as the politics of
      Babbiano are concerned, may be true; our resistance of Gian Maria may
      indeed be losing him his throne and doing good service to the cause of the
      Count of Aquila; but how shall all this prove that lie of yours, that
      Messer Francesco&mdash;for it is clearly of him you speak&mdash;that
      Messer Francesco should be this agent of the Count&rsquo;s? It is a lie,
      Gonzaga, for which you shall be punished as you deserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and stood awaiting his reply, and as she watched him his calm
      demeanour struck a chill into her heart. He was so confident, so full of
      assurance; and that, in Gonzaga, she had learnt to know meant a strong
      bulwark &lsquo;twixt himself and danger. He sighed profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, these cruel words of yours do not wound me, since they are no
      more than I expected. But it will wound me&mdash;and sorely&mdash;if when
      you shall have learnt the rest you do not humbly acknowledge how you have
      wronged me, how grossly you have misjudged me. You think I come to you
      with evil in my heart, urged by a spirit of vindictiveness against Messer
      Francesco. Instead, I come to you with nothing but a profound sorrow that
      mine must be the voice to disillusion you, and a deep indignation against
      him that has so foully used you to his own ends. Wait, Madonna! In a
      measure you are right. It was not strictly true to say that this Messer
      Francesco is the agent of the Count of Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You are recanting already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little&mdash;an insignificant little. He is no agent because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       He hesitated, and glanced swiftly up. Then he sighed, lowered his voice,
      and with consummately simulated sorrow, he concluded &ldquo;Because he is,
      himself, Francesco del Falco. Count of Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swayed a moment, and the colour died from her cheeks, leaving them
      ivory pale. She leaned heavily against the table, and turned over in her
      mind what she had heard. And then, as suddenly as it had gone, the blood
      rushed back into her face, mounting to her very temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; she blazed at him; &ldquo;a lie for which you shall be whipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, and cast Francesco&rsquo;s letter on to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Madonna, is something that will prove all that I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She eyed the paper coldly. Her first impulse was to call Fortemani and
      carry out her threat of having Gonzaga whipped, refusing so much as to see
      this thing that he so confidently termed a proof; but it may be that his
      confidence wrought upon her, touching a chord of feminine curiosity. That
      he was wrong she never doubted; but that he believed himself right she was
      also assured, and she wondered what this thing might be that had so
      convinced him. Still she did not touch it, but asked in an indifferent
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter that was brought hither to-night by a man who swam the moat, and
      whom I have ordered to be detained in the armoury tower. It is from
      Fanfulla degli Arcipreti to the Count of Aquila. If your memory will bear
      you back to a certain day at Acquasparta, you may recall that Fanfulla was
      the name of a very gallant cavalier who addressed this Messer Francesco
      with marked respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took that backward mental glance he bade her, and remembered. Then she
      remembered, too, how that very evening Francesco had said that he was
      fretting for news of Babbiano, and that when she had asked how he hoped
      that news could reach him at Roccaleone, Gonzaga had entered before he
      answered her. Indeed, he had seemed to hesitate upon that answer. A sudden
      chill encompassed her at that reflection. Oh, it was impossible, absurd!
      And yet she took the letter from the table. With knit brows she read it,
      whilst Gonzaga watched her, scarce able to keep the satisfaction from
      gleaming in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read it slowly, and as she read her face grew deathly pale. When she
      had finished she stood silent for a long minute, her eyes upon the
      signature and her mind harking back to what Gonzaga had said, and drawing
      comparison between that and such things as had been done and uttered, and
      nowhere did she find the slightest gleam of that discrepancy which so
      ardently she sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if a hand were crushing the heart in her bosom. This man whom
      she had trusted, this peerless champion of her cause, to be nothing but a
      self-seeker, an intriguer, who, to advance his own ends, had made a pawn
      of her. She thought of how for a moment he had held her in his arms and
      kissed her, and at that her whole soul revolted against the notion that
      here was no more than treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a plot against him!&rdquo; she cried, her cheeks scarlet again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      an infamous thing of your devising, Messer Gonzaga, an odious lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, the man that brought the letter is still detained. Confront him
      with Messer Francesco; or apply the question to him, and learn his
      master&rsquo;s true name and station. As for the rest, if that letter is
      insufficient proof for you, I beg that you will look back at facts. Why
      should he lie to you? and say that his name was Francesco Franceschi? Why
      should he have urged you&mdash;against all reason&mdash;to remain here,
      when he brought you news that Gian Maria was advancing? Surely had he but
      sought to serve you he had better accomplished this by placing his own
      castle of Aquila at your disposal, and leaving here an empty nest for Gian
      Maria, as I urged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank to a chair, a fever in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Madonna, there is no mistake. What I have said is true.
      Another three days would he have held Gian Maria here, whilst if you gave
      him that letter, it is odds he would slip away in the night of to-morrow,
      that he might be in Babbiano on the third day to take the throne his
      cousin treats so lightly. Sainted God!&rdquo; he cried out. &ldquo;I think this is the
      most diabolically treacherous plot that ever mind of man conceived and
      human heartlessness executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;all this is presupposing that
      Messer Francesco is indeed the Count of Aquila. May there&mdash;may it not
      be that this letter was meant for some other destination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you confront this messenger with the Count?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the Count?&rdquo; she inquired dully. &ldquo;With Messer Francesco, you mean?&rdquo;
       She shuddered, and with strange inconsistence: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, in a
      choking voice, her lip twisting oddly at the corner. &ldquo;I do not wish to see
      his face again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light gleamed in Gonzaga&rsquo;s eye, and was extinguished on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best make certain,&rdquo; he suggested, rising. &ldquo;I have ordered Fortemani to
      bring Lanciotto here. He will be waiting now, without. Shall I admit
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded without speaking, and Gonzaga opened the door, and called
      Fortemani. A voice answered him from the gloom of the banqueting-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring Lanciotto here,&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Francesco&rsquo;s servant entered, a look of surprise on his face at these
      mysterious proceedings, it was Valentina who questioned him, and that in a
      voice as cold as though the issue concerned her no whit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, sirrah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and as you value your neck, see that you
      answer me truly&mdash;what is your master&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lanciotto looked from her to Gonzaga, who stood by, a cynical curl on his
      sensual lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer Monna Valentina,&rdquo; the courtier urged him. &ldquo;State your master&rsquo;s
      true name and station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, lady,&rdquo; began Lanciotto, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; she stormed, her small clenched hands beating the table in
      harsh impatience. And Lanciotto, seeing no help for it, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messer Francesco del Falco, Count of Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something that began in a sob and ended in a laugh burst from the lips of
      Valentina. Ercole&rsquo;s eyes were wide at the news, and he might have gone the
      length of interposing a question, when Gonzaga curtly bade him go to the
      armoury tower, and bring thence the soldier and the man Gonzaga had left
      in his care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave no shadow of doubt in your mind, Madonna,&rdquo; he said in
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited in silence&mdash;for Lanciotto&rsquo;s presence hindered
      conversation&mdash;until Ercole returned accompanied by the man-at-arms
      and Zaccaria, who had now changed his raiment. Before they could question
      the new-comer, such questions as they might have put were answered by the
      greeting that passed between him and his fellow-servant Lanciotto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga turned to Valentina. She sat very still, her tawny head bowed and
      in her eyes a look of sore distress. And in that instant a brisk step
      sounded without. The door was thrust open, and Francesco himself stood
      upon the threshold, with Peppe&rsquo;s alarmed face showing behind him. Gonzaga
      instinctively drew back a pace, and his countenance lost some of its
      colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Francesco, Zaccaria rushed forward and bowed profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord!&rdquo; he greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if one little thing had been wanting to complete the evidence against
      the Count, that thing, by an odd mischance, Francesco himself seemed to
      supply. The strange group in that dining-room claiming his attention, and
      the portentous air that hung about those present, confirmed the warning
      Peppe had brought him that something was amiss. He disregarded utterly his
      servant&rsquo;s greeting, and with eyes of a perplexity that may have worn the
      look of alarm he sought the face of Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose upon the instant, an angry red colouring her cheeks. His very
      glance, it seemed, was become an affront unbearable after what had passed&mdash;for
      the memory of his kiss bit like a poisoned fang into her brain. An odd
      laugh broke from her. She made a gesture towards Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortemani, you will place the Count of Aquila under arrest,&rdquo; she
      commanded, in a stern, steady voice, &ldquo;and as you value your life you will
      see that he does not elude you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great bully hesitated. His knowledge of Francesco&rsquo;s methods was not
      encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna!&rdquo; gasped Francesco, his bewilderment increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear me, Fortemani,&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Remove him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord?&rdquo; cried Lanciotto, laying hand to his sword his eyes upon his
      master&rsquo;s, ready to draw and lay about him at a glance of bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Let be,&rdquo; answered Franeesco coldly. &ldquo;Here, Messer Fortemani.&rdquo; And he
      proffered his dagger, the only weapon that he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina, calling Gonzaga to attend her, made shift to quit the
      apartment. At that Francesco seemed to awaken to his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, wait,&rdquo; he cried, and he stepped deliberately before her. &ldquo;You
      must hear me. I have surrendered in earnest of my faith and confident that
      once you have heard me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Fortemani,&rdquo; she cried, almost angrily, &ldquo;will you restrain your
      prisoner? I wish to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ercole, with visible reluctance, laid a hand on Francesco&rsquo;s shoulder; but
      it was unnecessary. Before her words, the Count recoiled as if he had been
      struck. He stood clear of her path with a gasp at once of unbelief and
      angry resignation. An instant his eyes rested on Gonzaga, so fiercely that
      the faint smile withered on the courtier&rsquo;s lips, and his knees trembled
      under him as he hastened from the room in Valentina&rsquo;s wake.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. IN THE ARMOURY TOWER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rough stones of the inner courtyard shone clean and bright in the
      morning sun, still wet with the heavy rains that had washed them
      yesternight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool sat on a rude stool within the porch of the long gallery, and,
      moodily eyeing that glistening pavement, ruminated. He was angry, which,
      saving where Fra Domenico was concerned, was a rare thing with
      good-humoured Peppe. He had sought to reason with Monna Valentina touching
      the imprisonment in his chamber of Messer Francesco, and she had bidden
      him confine his attention to his capers with a harshness he had never
      known in her before. But he had braved her commands, and astonished her
      with the information that the true identity of this Messer Francesco had
      been known to him since that day when they had first met him at
      Acquasparta. He had meant to say more. He had meant to add the
      announcement of Francesco&rsquo;s banishment from Babbiano and his notorious
      unwillingness to mount his cousin&rsquo;s throne. He had meant to make her
      understand that had Francesco been so minded, he had no need to stoop to
      such an act as this that she imputed to him. But she had cut him short,
      and with angry words and angrier threats she had driven him from her
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she was gone to Mass, and the fool had taken shelter in the porch
      of the gallery, that there he might vent some of his ill-humour&mdash;or
      indeed indulge it&mdash;in pondering the obtuseness of woman and the
      insidiousness of Gonzaga, to whom he never doubted that this miserable
      state of things was due.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he sat there&mdash;a grotesque, misshapen figure in gaudy motley&mdash;an
      ungovernable rage possessed him. What was to become of them now? Without
      the Count of Aquila&rsquo;s stern support the garrison would have forced her to
      capitulate a week ago. What would betide, now that the restraint of his
      formidable command was withdrawn?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will know her folly when it&rsquo;s too late. It&rsquo;s the way of women,&rdquo; he
      assured himself. And, loving his mistress as he did, his faithful soul was
      stricken at the thought. He would wait there until she returned from Mass,
      and then she should hear him&mdash;all should hear him. He would not
      permit himself to be driven away again so easily. He was intently turning
      over in his mind what he would say, with what startling, pregnant sentence
      he would compel attention, when he was startled by the appearance of a
      figure on the chapel steps. Sudden and quietly as an apparition it came,
      but it bore the semblance of Romeo Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of him, Peppe instinctively drew back into the shadows of the
      porch, his eyes discerning the suspicious furtiveness of the courtier&rsquo;s
      movements, and watching them with a grim eagerness. He saw Romeo look
      carefully about him, and then descend the steps on tiptoe, evidently so
      that no echo of his footfalls should reach those within the chapel. Then,
      never suspecting the presence of Peppe, he sped briskly across the yard
      and vanished through the archway that led to the outer court. And the
      fool, assured that some knowledge of the courtier&rsquo;s purpose would not be
      amiss, set out to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his room under the Lion&rsquo;s Tower the Count of Aquila had spent a
      restless night, exercised by those same fears touching the fate of the
      castle that had beset the fool, but less readily attributing his
      confinement to Gonzaga&rsquo;s scheming. Zaccaria&rsquo;s presence had told him that
      Fanfulla must at last have written, and he could but assume that the
      letter, falling into Monna Valentina&rsquo;s hands, should have contained
      something that she construed into treason on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitterly he reproached himself now with not having from the very outset
      been frank with her touching his identity; bitterly he reproached her with
      not so much as giving a hearing to the man she had professed to love. Had
      she but told him upon what grounds her suspicions against him had been
      founded, he was assured that he could have dispelled them at a word,
      making clear their baselessness and his own honesty of purpose towards
      her. Most of all was he fretted by the fact that Zaccaria&rsquo;s presence,
      after a coming so long expected and so long delayed, argued that the news
      he bore was momentous. From this it might result that Gian Maria should
      move at any moment and that his action might be of a desperate character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now through the ranks of Fortemani&rsquo;s men there had run an inevitable
      dismay at Francesco&rsquo;s arrest, and a resentment against Valentina who had
      encompassed it. His hand it was that had held them together, his judgment&mdash;of
      which they had had unequivocal signs&mdash;that had given them courage. He
      was a leader who had shown himself capable of leading, and out of
      confidence for whom they would have undertaken anything that he bade them.
      Whom had they now? Fortemani was but one of themselves, placed in command
      over them by an event purely adventitious. Gonzaga was a fop whose capers
      they mimicked and whose wits they despised; whilst Valentina, though brave
      enough and high-spirited, remained a girl of no worldly and less military
      knowledge, whose orders it might be suicidal to carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now by none were these opinions more strongly entertained than by Ercole
      Fortemani himself. Never had he performed anything with greater reluctance
      than the apprehension of Francesco, and when he thought of what was likely
      to follow his consternation knew no bounds. He had come to respect and, in
      his rough way, even to love their masterful Provost, and since learning
      his true identity, in the hour of arresting him, his admiration had grown
      to something akin to reverence for the condottiero whose name to the
      men-at-arms of Italy was like the name of some patron saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure the safe keeping of his captive, he had been ordered by Gonzaga,
      who now resumed command of Roccaleone, to spend the night in the ante-room
      of Francesco&rsquo;s chamber. These orders he had exceeded by spending a
      considerable portion of the night in the Count&rsquo;s very room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have but to speak,&rdquo; the bully had sworn, by way of showing Francesco
      the true nature of his feelings, &ldquo;and the castle is yours. At a word from
      you my men will flock to obey you, and you may do your will at
      Roccaleone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foul traitor that you are,&rdquo; Francesco had laughed at him. &ldquo;Do you forget
      under whom you have taken service? Let be what is, Ercole. But if a favour
      you would do me, let me see Zaccaria&mdash;the man that came to Roccaleone
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This Ercole had done for him. Now Zaccaria was fully aware of the contents
      of the letter he had carried, having been instructed by Fanfulla against
      the chance arising of his being compelled, for his safety, to destroy it&mdash;an
      expedient to which he now bitterly repented him that he had not had
      recourse. From Zaccaria, then, Francesco learnt all that there was to
      learn, and since the knowledge but confirmed his fears that Gian Maria
      would delay action no longer, he fell a prey to the most passionate
      impatience at his own detention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the grey hours of the morning he grew calmer, and by the light of a
      lamp that he had called Ercole to replenish, he sat down to write a letter
      to Valentina, which he thought should carry conviction of his honesty to
      her heart. Since she would not hear him, this was the only course. At the
      end of an hour&mdash;his moribund light grown yellow now that the sun was
      risen&mdash;his letter was accomplished, and he summoned Ercole again, to
      charge him to deliver it at once to Monna Valentina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall await her return from chapel,&rdquo; answered Ercole. He took the
      letter and departed. As he emerged into the courtyard he was startled to
      see the fool dash towards him, gasping for breath, and with excitement in
      every line of his quaint face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quickly, Ercole!&rdquo; Peppe enjoined him. &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil take you, spawn of Satan&mdash;whither?&rdquo; growled the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you as we go. We have not a moment to spare. There is
      treachery afoot&mdash;&mdash; Gonzaga&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped, and ended
      desperately: &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani needed no second bidding. The chance of catching pretty Messer
      Romeo at a treachery was too sweet a lure. Snorting and puffing&mdash;for
      hard drinking had sorely impaired his wind&mdash;the great captain hurried
      the fool along, listening as they went to the gasps in which he brought
      out his story. It was not much, after all. Peppe had seen Messer Gonzaga
      repair to the armoury tower. Through an arrow-slit he had watched him take
      down and examine an arbalest, place it on the table and sit down to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Ercole. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naught else. That is all,&rdquo; answered the hunchback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven and hell!&rdquo; roared the swashbuckler, coming to a standstill and
      glowering down upon his impatient companion. &ldquo;And you have made me run for
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it not enough?&rdquo; retorted Peppe testily. &ldquo;Will you come on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a foot farther,&rdquo; returned the captain, getting very angry. &ldquo;Is this a
      miserable jest? What of the treachery you spoke of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter and an arbalest!&rdquo; panted the maddened Peppe, grimacing horribly
      at this delay. &ldquo;God, was there ever such a fool! Does this mean nothing to
      that thick, empty thing you call a head? Have you forgotten how Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s offer of a thousand florins came to Roccaleone? On an arbalest
      quarrel, stupid! Come on, I say, and afterwards you shall have my motley&mdash;the
      only livery you have a right to wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the shock of enlightenment Ercole forgot to cuff the jester for his
      insolence, and allowed himself once more to be hurried along, across the
      outer court and up the steps that led to the battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had best tread more softly,&rdquo; snapped the fool, under his
      breath, &ldquo;and control that thunderous wheeze, if you would surprise Ser
      Romeo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ercole accepted the hint, meek as a lamb, and leaving the fool behind him
      on the steps, he went softly up, and approached the armoury tower. Peering
      cautiously through the arrow-slit, and favoured by the fact that Gonzaga&rsquo;s
      back was towards him, he saw that he was no more than in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtier was bending down, and by the creaking sound that reached him
      Ercole guessed his occupation to be the winding of the arbalest string. On
      the table at his side lay a quarrel swathed in a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly and silently Ercole moved round the tower, and the next instant he
      had pushed open the unfastened door and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scream of terror greeted him, and a very startled face was turned upon
      him by Gonzaga, who instantly sprang upright. Then, seeing who it was, the
      courtier&rsquo;s face reassumed some of its normal composure, but his glance was
      uneasy and his cheek pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sant Iddio!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You startled me, Ercole. I did not hear you
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now something in the bully&rsquo;s face heightened the alarm in Gonzaga. He
      still made an effort at self-control, as planting himself between Ercole
      and the table, so as to screen the tell-tale shaft, he asked him what he
      sought there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That letter you have written Gian Maria,&rdquo; was the gruff, uncompromising
      answer, for Ercole reeked nothing of diplomatic issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga&rsquo;s mouth jerked itself open, and his upper lip shuddered against
      his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;&mdash; Wha&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that letter,&rdquo; Ercole insisted, now advancing upon him, and
      wearing an air of ferocity that drove back into Gonzaga&rsquo;s throat such
      resentful words as he bethought him of. Then, like an animal at bay&mdash;and
      even a rat will assert itself then&mdash;he swung aloft the heavy arbalest
      he held, and stood barring Ercole&rsquo;s way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;or by God and His saints, I&rsquo;ll beat your brains
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a guttural laugh from the swashbuckler, and then his arms were
      round Gonzaga&rsquo;s shapely waist, and the popinjay was lifted from his feet.
      Viciously he brought down the cross-bow, as he had threatened; but it
      smote the empty air. The next instant Gonzaga was hurtled, bruised, into a
      corner of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a rage so great that he felt it draining him of his very strength and
      choking the breath in his body, he made a movement to rise and fling
      himself again upon his aggressor. But Fortemani was down upon him, and for
      all his struggles contrived to turn him over on his face, twisting his
      arms behind him, and making them fast with a belt that lay at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie still, you scorpion!&rdquo; growled the ruffler, breathing hard from his
      exertions. He rose, took the shaft with the letter tied about it, read the
      superscription&mdash;&ldquo;To the High and Mighty Lord Gian Maria Sforza&rdquo;&mdash;and
      with a chuckle of mingled relish and scorn, he was gone, locking the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Gonzaga lay face downward where he had been flung, able to do
      little more than groan and sweat in the extremity of his despair, whilst
      he awaited the coming of those who would probably make an end of him. Not
      even from Valentina could he hope for mercy, so incriminating was the note
      he had penned. His letter was to enjoin the Duke to hold his men in
      readiness at the hour of the Angelus next morning, and to wait until
      Gonzaga should wave a handkerchief from the battlements. At that he was to
      advance immediately to the postern, which he would find open, and the
      rest, Gonzaga promised him, would be easy. He would take the whole
      garrison at their prayers and weaponless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Francesco read it a light leapt to his eye and an oath to his lips;
      but neither glance nor oath were of execration, as Ercole stood expecting.
      A sudden idea flashed through the Count&rsquo;s mind, so strange and humorous
      and yet so full of promise of easy accomplishment, that he burst into a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now may God bless this fool for the most opportune of traitors!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, in surprise at which Fortemani&rsquo;s mouth fell open, and the eyes
      of Peppe grew very round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ercole, my friend, here is a bait to trap that lout my cousin, such as I
      could never have devised myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it back to him,&rdquo; cried the Count, holding out the letter with a hand
      that trembled in the eagerness of his spirit. &ldquo;Take it back, and get him
      by fair means or foul to shoot it as he intended; or if he refuses, why,
      then, do you seal it up and shoot it yourself. But see that it gets to
      Gian Maria!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not know what you intend?&rdquo; quoth the bewildered Ercole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time, my friend. First do my bidding with that letter.
      Listen! It were best that having read it you agree to join him in his
      betrayal of Roccaleone, your own fears as to the ultimate fate awaiting
      you at Gian Maria&rsquo;s hands being aroused. Urge him to promise you money,
      immunity, what you will, as your reward; but make him believe you sincere,
      and induce him to shoot his precious bolt. Now go! Lose no time, or they
      may be returning from chapel, and your opportunity will be lost. Come to
      me here, afterwards, and I will tell you what is in my mind. We shall have
      a busy night of it to-night, Ercole, and you must set me free when the
      others are abed. Now go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ercole went, and Peppe, remaining, plagued the Count with questions which
      he answered until in the end the fool caught the drift of his scheme, and
      swore impudently that a greater jester than his Excellency did not live.
      Then Ercole returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it done? Has the letter gone?&rdquo; cried Francesco. Fortemani nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are sworn brothers in this business, he and I. He added a line to his
      note to say that he had gained my cooperation, and that, therefore,
      immunity was expected for me too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done well, Ercole.&rdquo; Francesco applauded him. &ldquo;Now return me the
      letter I gave you for Monna Valentina. There is no longer the need for it.
      But return to me to-night toward the fourth hour, when all are abed, and
      bring with you my men, Lanciotto and Zaccaria.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE INTERRUPTED MASS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning of that Wednesday of Corpus Christi, fateful to all concerned
      in this chronicle, dawned misty and grey, and the air was chilled by the
      wind that blew from the sea. The chapel bell tinkled out its summons, and
      the garrison trooped faithfully to Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently came Monna Valentina, followed by her ladies, her pages, and
      lastly, Peppe, wearing under his thin mask of piety an air of eager
      anxiety and unrest. Valentina was very pale, and round her eyes there were
      dark circles that told of sleeplessness, and as she bowed her head in
      prayer, her ladies observed that tears were falling on the illuminated
      Mass-book over which she bent. And now came Fra Domenico from the sacristy
      in the white chasuble that the Church ordains for the Corpus Christi
      feast, followed by a page in a clerkly gown of black, and the Mass
      commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were absent only from the gathering Gonzaga and Fortemani, besides a
      sentry and the three prisoners. Francesco and his two followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga had presented himself to Valentina with the plausible tale that,
      as the events of which Fanfulla&rsquo;s letter had given them knowledge might
      lead Gian Maria at any moment to desperate measures, it might be well that
      he should reinforce the single man-at-arms patrolling the walls.
      Valentina, little recking now whether the castle held or fell, and still
      less such trifles as Gonzaga&rsquo;s attendance at Mass, had assented without
      heeding the import of what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, his face drawn and his body quivering with the excitement of what
      he was about to do, Gonzaga had repaired to the ramparts so soon as he had
      seen them all safely into chapel. The sentinel was that same clerkly youth
      Aventano, who had read to the soldiers that letter Gian Maria had sent
      Gonzaga. This the courtier accepted as a good omen. If a man there was
      among the soldiery at Roccaleone with whom he deemed that he had an
      account to settle, that man was Aventano.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist was rapidly lightening, and the country grew visible for miles
      around. In the camp of Gian Maria he observed a coming and going of men
      that argued an inordinate bustle for so early an hour. They awaited his
      signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached the young sentinel, growing more and more nervous as the
      time for action advanced. He cursed Fortemani, who had selfishly refused
      to take an active part in the admission of Gian Maria. Here was a task
      that Fortemani could perform more satisfactorily than he. He had urged
      this fact on Ercole&rsquo;s attention, but the swashbuckler had grinned and
      shook his head. To Gonzaga fell the greater reward, and so Gonzaga must do
      the greater work. It was only fair, the knave had urged; and while Gonzaga
      was about it, he would watch the chapel door against interruption. And so
      Gonzaga had been forced to come alone to try conclusions with the sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the young man a nervous but pleasant &ldquo;Good-morrow,&rdquo; and observed
      with satisfaction that he wore no body armour. His original intention had
      been to attempt to suborn him, and render him pliable by bribery; but now
      that the moment for action was arrived he dared not make the offer. He
      lacked for words in which to present his proposal, and he was afraid lest
      the man should resent it, and in a fit of indignation attack him with his
      partisan. He little imagined that Aventano had been forewarned by Ercole
      that a bribe would be offered him and that he was to accept it promptly.
      Ercole had chosen this man because he was intelligent, and had made him
      understand enough of what was toward, besides offering a substantial
      reward if he played his part well, and Aventano waited. But Gonzaga,
      knowing naught of this, abandoned at the last moment the notion of bribing
      him&mdash;which Ercole had enjoined him, and which he in his turn had
      promised Ercole was the course he would pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem cold, Excellency,&rdquo; said the young man deferentially, for he had
      observed that Gonzaga shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chill morning, Aventano,&rdquo; returned the gallant, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but the sun is breaking through yonder. It will be warmer soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered the other abstractedly, and still he remained by the
      sentinel, his hand, under the gay mantle of blue velvet, nervously
      fingering the hilt of a dagger that he dared not draw. It came to him that
      moments were passing, and that the thing must be done. Yet Aventano was a
      sinewy youth, and if the sudden stab he meditated failed him, he would be
      at the fellow&rsquo;s mercy. At the thought he shivered again, and his face
      turned grey. He moved away a step, and then inspiration brought him a
      cruel ruse. He uttered a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he exclaimed, his eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Aventano was beside him, for his voice had sounded alarmed&mdash;a
      tone, in his present condition, not difficult to simulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Excellency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down there,&rdquo; cried Gonzaga excitedly. &ldquo;There from that fissure in the
      stone. Saw you nothing?&rdquo; And he pointed to the ground at a spot where two
      slabs met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw nothing, Illustrious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like a flash of yellow light below there. What is under us here?
      I&rsquo;ll swear there&rsquo;s treachery at work. Get down on your knees, and try if
      anything is to be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a wondering glance at the courtier&rsquo;s white, twitching face, the
      unfortunate young man went down on all fours to do his bidding. After all&mdash;poor
      fellow!&mdash;he was hardly intelligent as Fortemani opined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing, Excellency,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The plaster is cracked. But&mdash;&mdash;
      Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a panic of haste Gonzaga had whipped the dagger from its sheath and
      sunk it into the middle of Aventano&rsquo;s broad back. The fellow&rsquo;s arms slid
      out, and with a long-drawn, gurgling sigh he sank down and stretched
      himself horribly on the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that instant the clouds parted overhead and the sun came out in a blaze
      of golden glory. High above Gonzaga&rsquo;s head a lark burst into song.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the assassin remained standing above the body of his victim
      with head sunk between the shoulders like a man who expects a blow, his
      face grey, his teeth chattering, and his mouth twitching hideously. A
      shudder shook him. It was the first life he had taken, and that carrion at
      his feet filled him with sickly horror. Not for a kingdom&mdash;not to
      save his vile soul from the eternal damnation that act had earned it&mdash;would
      he have dared stoop to pluck the dagger from the back of the wretch he had
      murdered. With something like a scream he turned, and fled in a panic from
      the spot. Panting with horror, yet subconsciously aware of the work he had
      to do, he paused a moment to wave a kerchief, then dashed down the steps
      to the postern.
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers he unlocked the door and set it wide to Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s men, who, in answer to his signal, were now hurrying forward with
      a bridge composed of pine trees, that they had hastily and roughly put
      together during the previous day. This, with some efforts and more noise
      than Gonzaga relished, was thrust across the moat. One of the men crept
      across, and assisted Gonzaga to make fast his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Gian Maria and Guidobaldo stood in the castle-yard, and
      after them came almost every man of the five score that Gian Maria had
      brought to that siege. This was what Francesco had confidently expected,
      knowing that it was not his cousin&rsquo;s way to run any risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Babbiauo, whose face was disfigured by a bristling hedge of
      reddish stubble&mdash;for in obedience to the vow he had made, he now
      carried a fortnight&rsquo;s growth of beard on his round face&mdash;turned to
      Gonzaga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all well?&rdquo; he asked, in a friendly tone, whilst Guidobaldo
      contemptuously eyed the popinjay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga assured them that the whole thing had been effected without
      disturbing the garrison at their prayers. Now that he deemed himself well
      protected his usual serenity of manner returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may felicitate yourself, Highness,&rdquo; he ventured to say, with a grin,
      to Guidobaldo, &ldquo;that you have reared your niece in devout ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you address me?&rdquo; quoth the Duke of Urbino coldly. &ldquo;I trust it may not
      again be necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the look of loathing in his handsome face Gonzaga cringed. Gian
      Maria laughed in his piping treble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not served your Highness faithfully?&rdquo; fawned the gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So has the meanest scullion in my kitchens, the lowliest groom in my
      stables&mdash;and with more honour to himself,&rdquo; answered the proud Duke.
      &ldquo;Yet he does not go the length of jesting with me.&rdquo; His eye carried a
      menace so eloquent that Gonzaga drew back, afraid; but Gian Maria clapped
      him on the shoulder in a friendly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of good heart, Judas,&rdquo; he laughed, his pale face a-grin, &ldquo;I shall find
      room for you in Babbiano, and work too, if you do it as well as this.
      Come; the men are here now. Let us go forward whilst they are at their
      prayers. But we must not disturb them,&rdquo; he added, more seriously. &ldquo;I will
      not be guilty of an impiety. We can lie in wait for them without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed gaily, for he seemed in a preposterously good humour, and
      bidding Gonzaga lead the way he followed, with Guidobaldo at his side.
      They crossed the courtyard, where his men were ranged, armed to the teeth,
      and at the door of the archway leading to the inner court they paused for
      Gonzaga to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment the gallant stood staring. Then he turned a face of consternation
      on the Dukes. His knees shook visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is locked,&rdquo; he announced, in a husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We made too much noise in entering,&rdquo; suggested Guidobaldo, &ldquo;and they have
      taken the alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation relieved the growing uneasiness in Gian Maria&rsquo;s mind. He
      turned with an oath to his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, some of you,&rdquo; his sharp voice commanded. &ldquo;Beat me down this door.
      By the Host! Do the fools think to keep me out so easily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was broken down, and they advanced. But only some half-dozen
      paces, for at the end of that short gallery they found the second door
      barring their progress. Through this, too, they broke, Gian Maria fiercely
      blaspheming at the delay. Yet when it was done he was none so eager to
      lead the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second courtyard he deemed it extremely probable that they should
      find Valentina&rsquo;s soldiers awaiting them. So bidding his men pass on, he
      remained behind with Guidobaldo until he heard word that the inner court
      was likewise empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the entire hundred of his followers were assembled there to
      overpower the twenty that served Monna Valentina; and Guidobaldo&mdash;despite
      Gian Maria&rsquo;s scruples&mdash;strode coolly forward to the chapel door.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Within the chapel Mass had started. Fra Domenico at the foot of the altar
      had pattered through the Confiteor, his deep voice responded to by the
      soprano of the ministering page. The Kyrie was being uttered when the
      attention of the congregation was attracted by the sound of steps
      approaching the chapel door to the accompaniment of an ominous clank of
      steel. The men rose in a body, fearing treachery, and cursing&mdash;despite
      the sanctity of the place&mdash;the circumstance that they were without
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door opened, and down the steps rang the armed heels of the
      new-comers, so that every eye was turned upon them, including that of Fra
      Domenico, who had pronounced the last &ldquo;Christe eleison&rdquo; in a quavering
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gasp of relief, followed by an angry cry from Valentina, went up when
      they recognised those that came. First stepped the Count of Aquila in full
      armour, sword at side and dagger on hip, carrying his head-piece on the
      crook of his left arm. Behind him towered the bulk of Fortemani, his great
      face flushed with a strange excitement, a leather hacketon over his steel
      cuirass, girt, too, with sword and dagger, and carrying his shining morion
      in his hand. Last came Lanciotto and Zaccaria, both fully equipped and
      armed at all points.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you that come thus accoutred into God&rsquo;s House to interrupt the
      holy Mass?&rdquo; cried the bass voice of the friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, good father,&rdquo; answered Francesco calmly, &ldquo;The occasion is our
      justification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean, Fortemani?&rdquo; demanded Valentina imperiously, her eyes
      angrily set upon her captain, utterly ignoring the Count. &ldquo;Do you betray
      me too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, Madonna,&rdquo; answered the giant bluntly, &ldquo;that your lap-dog,
      Messer Gonzaga, is at this very moment admitting Gian Maria and his forces
      to Roccaleone, by the postern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hoarse cry from the men, which Francesco silenced by a wave of
      his mailed hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valentina looked wildly at Fortemani, and then, as if drawn by a greater
      will than her own, her eyes were forced to travel to the Count. He
      instantly advanced, and bowed his head before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna, this is no hour for explanations. Action is needed, and that at
      once. I was wrong in not disclosing my identity to you before you
      discovered it by such unfortunate means and with the assistance of the
      only traitor Roccaleone has harboured, Romeo Gonzaga&mdash;who, as
      Fortemani has just told you, is at this moment admitting my cousin and
      your uncle to the castle. But that my object was ever other than to serve
      you, or that I sought, as was represented to you, to turn this siege to my
      own political profit, that, Madonna, I implore you in your own interests
      to believe untrue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank on to her knees and with folded hands began to pray to the Mother
      of Mercy, deeming herself lost, for his tone carried conviction, and he
      had said that Gian Maria was entering the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madonna,&rdquo; he cried, touching her lightly on the shoulder; &ldquo;let your
      prayers wait until they can be of thanksgiving. Listen. By the vigilance
      of Peppe there, who, good soul that he is, never lost faith in me or
      deemed me a dastard, we were informed last night&mdash;Fortemani and I&mdash;of
      this that Gonzaga was preparing. And we have made our plans and prepared
      the ground. When Gian Maria&rsquo;s soldiers enter, they will find the outer
      doors barred and locked, and we shall gain a little time while they break
      through them. My men, as you will observe, are even now barring the door
      of the chapel to impose a further obstacle. Now while they are thus
      engaged we must act. Briefly, then, if you will trust us we will bear you
      out of this, for we four have worked through the night to some purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him through a film of tears, her face drawn and startled.
      Then she put her hands to her brow in a gesture of bewildered
      helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will follow us,&rdquo; she complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. &ldquo;For that, too, have we provided. Come,
      Madonna, time presses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long moment she looked at him. Then brushing aside the tears that dimmed
      her sight, she set a hand on either of his shoulders, and stood so, before
      them all, gazing up into his calm face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I know that what you say is true&mdash;that I may trust you?&rdquo;
       she asked, but her voice was not the voice of one that demands an
      overwhelming proof ere she will believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my honour and my knighthood,&rdquo; he answered, in a ringing voice, &ldquo;I make
      oath here, at the foot of God&rsquo;s altar, that my purpose&mdash;my only
      purpose&mdash;has been, is, and shall be to serve you, Monna Valentina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; she cried; to sob a moment later:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Francesco, and may God, too, forgive my lack of faith in
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He softly breathed her name in such sweet accents that a happy peace
      pervaded her, and the bright courage of yore shone in her brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sirs!&rdquo; he cried now, with a sudden briskness that startled them
      into feverish obedience. &ldquo;You, Fra Domenico, cut off your sacerdotals, and
      gird high your habit. There is climbing for you. Here, a couple of you,
      move aside that altar-step. My men and I have spent the night in loosening
      its old hinges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They raised the slab, and in the gap beneath it was disclosed a flight of
      steps leading down to the dungeons and cellars of Roccaleone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down this they went in haste but in good order, marshalled by Francesco,
      and when the last had passed down, he and Lanciotto, aided by others
      below, who had seized a rope that he had lowered them, replaced the slab
      from underneath, so that no trace should remain of the way by which they
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      A postern had been unbarred below by Fortemani, who had led the way with a
      half-dozen of the men; and a huge scaling ladder that lay in readiness in
      that subterranean gallery was rushed out across the moat, which at this
      point was a roaring torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortemani was the first to descend that sloping bridge, and upon reaching
      the ground he made fast the lower end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next went a dozen men at Francesco&rsquo;s bidding, armed with the pikes that
      had been left overnight in the gallery. At a word of command they slipped
      quietly away. Then came the women, and lastly, the remainder of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the enemy they caught no glimpse; not so much as a sentry, for every
      one of Gian Maria&rsquo;s men had been pressed into the investment of the
      castle. Thus they emerged from Roccaleone, and made their way down that
      rough bridge into the pleasant meadows to the south. Already Fortemani and
      his dozen men had disappeared at the trot, making for the front of the
      castle, when Francesco stepped last upon the bridge, and closed the
      postern after him. Then he glided rapidly to the ground, and with the
      assistance of a dozen ready hands he dragged away the scaling ladder. They
      carried it some yards from the brink of the torrent, and deposited it in
      the meadow. With a laugh of purest relish Francesco stepped to Valentina&rsquo;s
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will exercise their minds to discover how we got out,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and
      they will be forced to the conclusion that we are angels all, with wings
      beneath our armour. We have not left them a single ladder or a strand of
      rope in Roccaleone by which to attempt to follow us, even if they discover
      how we came. But come, Valentina mia, the comedy is not finished yet.
      Already Fortemani will have removed the bridge by which they entered and
      engaged such few men as may have been left behind, and we have the High
      and Mighty Gian Maria in the tightest trap that was ever fashioned.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. THE CAPITULATION OF ROCCALEONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the sunshine of that bright May morning Francesco and his men went
      merrily to work to possess themselves of the ducal camp, and the first
      business of the day was to arm those soldiers who had come out unarmed. Of
      weapons there was no lack, and to these they helped themselves in liberal
      fashion, whilst here and there a man would pause to don a haubergeon or
      press a steel cap on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three sentries only had been left to guard the tents, and of these
      Fortemani and a couple of his men had made prisoners whilst the others
      were removing the bridge by which the invaders had entered. And now
      beneath the open postern by the drawbridge gaped a surging torrent that no
      man would have the hardihood to attempt to swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that opening, presently, appeared Gian Maria, his face red for once,
      and behind him a clamouring crowd of men-at-arms who shared their master&rsquo;s
      rage at the manner in which they had been trapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the rear of the tents Valentina and her ladies awaited the issue of the
      parley that now seemed toward. The bulk of the men were busy at Gian
      Maria&rsquo;s cannons, and under Francesco&rsquo;s supervision they were training them
      upon the drawbridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the castle a mighty shout went up. The men disappeared from the
      postern to reappear a moment later on the ramparts, and Francesco laughed
      deep down in his throat as he perceived the purpose of this. They had
      bethought them of the guns that were mounted there, and were gone to use
      them against Valentina&rsquo;s little army. Gun after gun they tried, and a
      fierce cry of rage burst forth when they realised by what dummies they had
      been held in check during the past week. This was followed by a silence of
      some moments, terminated at last by the sound of a bugle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering that summons to a parley, and with a last word of injunction to
      Fortemani, who was left in charge of the men at the guns, Francesco rode
      forward on one of Gian Maria&rsquo;s horses, escorted by Lanciotto and Zaccaria
      similarly mounted, and each armed with a loaded arquebuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the walls of Roccaleone he drew rein, laughing to himself at this
      monstrous change of sides. As he halted&mdash;helmet on head, but beaver
      open&mdash;a body came hurtling over the battlements and splashed into the
      foaming waters below. It was the corpse of Aventano, which Gian Maria had
      peremptorily bidden them to remove from his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire to speak with Monna Valentina della Rovere,&rdquo; cried the furious
      Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may speak with me, Gian Maria,&rdquo; answered Francesco&rsquo;s voice, clear and
      metallic. &ldquo;I am her representative, her sometime Provost of Roccaleone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; quoth the Duke, struck by a familiar note in that mocking
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francesco del Falco, Count of Aquila.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An age of marvels, is it not?&rdquo; laughed Francesco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which will you lose, my cousin&mdash;a wife or a duchy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rage struck Gian Maria speechless for a moment. Then he turned to
      Guidobaldo and whispered something; but Guidobaldo, who seemed vastly
      interested now in this knight below, merely shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lose neither, Messer Francesco,&rdquo; roared the Duke. &ldquo;Neither, by
      God!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Neither, do you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be deaf else,&rdquo; was the easy answer, &ldquo;But you are gravely at
      fault. One or the other you must relinquish, and it is yours to make a
      choice between them. The game has gone against you, Gian Maria, and you
      must pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have I no voice in the bartering of my niece?&rdquo; asked Guidobaldo, with
      cold dignity. &ldquo;Is it for you, Lord Count, to say whether your cousin shall
      wed her or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no. He may wed her if he will, but he will be a duke no longer. In
      fact, he will be an outcast with no title to lay claim to, if indeed the
      Babbianians will leave him a head at all; whilst I, at least, though not a
      duke with a tottering throne, am a count with lands, small but securely
      held, and shall become a duke if Gian Maria refuses to relinquish me your
      niece. So that if he be disposed to marry her, will you be disposed to let
      her marry a homeless vagrant or a headless corpse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo&rsquo;s face seemed to change, and his eyes looked curiously at the
      white-faced Duke beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are the other pretender to my niece&rsquo;s hand, Lord Count?&rdquo; he asked,
      in his coldest voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, Highness,&rdquo; answered Francesco quietly. &ldquo;The matter stands thus:
      Unless Gian Maria is in Babbiano by morning, he forfeits his crown, and it
      passes to me by the voice of the people; but if he will relinquish his
      claim to Monna Valentina in my favour, then I shall journey straight to
      Aquila, and I shall trouble Babbiano no more. If he refuses, and insists
      upon this wedding, abhorrent to Monna Valentina, why, then, my men shall
      hold him captive behind those walls until it be too late for him to reach
      his duchy in time to save the crown. In the meantime I will ride to
      Babbiano in his stead, and&mdash;reluctant though I be to play the duke&mdash;I
      shall accept the throne and silence the people&rsquo;s importunities. He can
      then endeavour to win your Highness&rsquo;s consent to the union.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For perhaps the first time in his life Guidobaldo was guilty of an act of
      positive discourtesy. He broke into a laugh&mdash;a boisterous, amused
      laugh that cut into Gian Maria&rsquo;s heart like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lord Count,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I confess that you have us very much in your
      hands to mould us as you will. Now, you are such a soldier and such a
      strategist as it would pleasure me to have about my person in Urbino. What
      says your Highness?&rdquo; he continued, turning now to the almost speechless
      Gian Maria. &ldquo;I have yet another niece with whom we might cement the union
      of the two duchies; and she might prove more willing. Women, it seems,
      will insist upon being women. Do you not think that Monna Valentina and
      this your valiant cousin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heed him not!&rdquo; screamed Gian Maria, now in a white heat of passion. &ldquo;He
      is a smooth-tongued dog that would argue the very devil out of hell. Make
      no terms with the hind! I have a hundred men, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He swung
      suddenly round. &ldquo;Let down that drawbridge, cowards!&rdquo; he bawled at them,
      &ldquo;and sweep me those animals from my tents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gian Maria, I give you warning,&rdquo; cried Francesco, loudly and firmly. &ldquo;I
      have trained your own guns on to that bridge, and at the first attempt to
      lower it I&rsquo;ll blow it into splinters. You come not out of Roccaleone save
      at my pleasure and upon my terms, and if you lose your duchy by your
      obstinacy, it will be your own work; but answer me now, that I may take my
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo, too, restrained Gian Maria, and countermanded his order for
      the lowering of the bridge. And now on his other side Gonzaga crept up to
      him, and whispered into his ear the suggestion that he should wait until
      night had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until night, fool!&rdquo; blazed the Duke, turning on him, in a fierce joy
      at finding one whom he might rend. &ldquo;If I wait until then, my throne is
      lost to me. This comes of sorting with traitors. It is your fault, you
      Judas!&rdquo; he cried more fiercely still, his face distorted; &ldquo;but you at
      least shall pay for what you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gonzaga saw a sudden flash of steel before his eyes, and a piercing scream
      broke from him as Gian Maria&rsquo;s dagger buried itself in his breast. Too
      late Guidobaldo put forward a hand to stay the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, by a strangely avenging justice, the magnificent Gonzaga sank dead
      on the very spot on which he had so cravenly and dastardly poniarded
      Aventano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw me that carrion into the moat,&rdquo; growled Gian Maria, still quivering
      with rage that had prompted his ferocious act.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obeyed, and thus murdered and murderer were united in a common
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first attempt to restrain Gian Maria, Guidobaldo had looked on
      in unconcern, deeming the act a very fitting punishment of a man with
      whose treachery he, at least, had never been in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he saw the body vanish in the torrent below, Gian Maria seemed to
      realise what he had done. His anger fell from him, and with bent head he
      piously crossed himself. Then turning to an attendant who stood at his
      elbow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that a Mass is said for his soul to-morrow,&rdquo; he solemnly bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if the act had served to pacify him and restore him to his senses, Gian
      Maria now stepped forward and asked his cousin, in calmer tones than he
      had hitherto employed, to make clear the terms on which he would permit
      him to return to Babbiano within the time to which his people limited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are no more than that you relinquish your claim to Monna Valentina,
      and that you find consolation&mdash;as I think his Highness of Urbino has
      himself suggested&mdash;in the Lord Guidobaldo&rsquo;s younger niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could reply Guidobaldo was urging him, in a low voice to accept
      the terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else is there for you?&rdquo; Montefeltro ended pregnantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this other niece of yours&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; quoth Gian Maria lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already passed my word,&rdquo; answered Guidobaldo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Monna Valentina?&rdquo; the other almost whined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May wed this headstrong condottiero of hers. I&rsquo;ll not withstand them.
      Come; I am your friend in this. I am even sacrificing Valentina to your
      interests. For if you persist, he will ruin you. The game is his, my lord.
      Acknowledge your defeat, as I acknowledge mine, and pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is your defeat to mine?&rdquo; cried Gian Maria, who saw through
      Guidobaldo&rsquo;s appreciation of the fact that such a nephew-in-law as
      Francesco del Falco was far from undesirable in the troublous times that
      threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at least as absolute,&rdquo; returned Guidobaldo, with a shrug. And in
      this vein the Duke of Urbino continued for some moments, till, in the end,
      Gian Maria found himself not only deserted by his ally, but having this
      ally now combating on his cousin&rsquo;s side and pressing him to accept his
      cousin&rsquo;s terms, distasteful though they were. Thus urged, Gian Maria
      lamely acknowledged his defeat and his willingness to pay the forfeit.
      With that he asked how soon he might be permitted to leave the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at once, now that I have your word,&rdquo; answered Francesco readily,
      whereat treachery gleamed from Gian Maria&rsquo;s eye, to be swiftly quenched by
      Francesco&rsquo;s next words. &ldquo;But lest your men and mine should come to trouble
      with one another, you will order yours to come forth without arms or
      armour, and you will depose your own. His Highness Guidobaldo is the only
      man in whose favour I can make an exception to this condition. Let it be
      broken, and I promise you that you will very bitterly regret it. At sight
      of the first armed man issuing from those gates, I&rsquo;ll give the word to
      fire on you, and your own guns shall work your destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the second siege of Roccaleone ended almost as soon as it was
      begun, and thus did Gian Maria capitulate to the conqueror. The Duke of
      Babbiano and his men marched out sheepishly and silently, and took their
      way to Babbiano, no word&mdash;not even so much as a glance&mdash;passing
      between Gian Maria and the lady who had been the cause of his
      discomfiture, and who blithely looked on at his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guidobaldo and his few attendants lingered after his late ally had gone.
      Then he bade Francesco lead him to his niece, in which Francesco readily
      obeyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke embraced her coldly&mdash;still that he embraced her at all after
      what was passed augured well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come with me to Urbino, Lord Count?&rdquo; he said suddenly to
      Francesco. &ldquo;It were best to celebrate the nuptials there. Everything is in
      readiness&mdash;for all had been prepared for Gian Maria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great joy came into Valentina&rsquo;s eyes; her cheeks flushed and her glance
      fell; but Francesco scanned the Duke&rsquo;s face with the keen eye of one who
      is incredulous of so much good fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Highness means me well?&rdquo; he made bold to ask. Guidobaldo stiffened,
      and a frown broke the serenity of his lofty brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my princely word,&rdquo; he answered solemnly, at which, with bended
      knee, Francesco stooped to kiss his ducal hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they departed on the horses that they kept as the spoils of war.
      They made a goodly show, Guidobaldo riding at their head, with Francesco
      and Valentina, whilst the rear was brought up by Peppe and Fra Domenico,
      who, touched by this epidemic of goodwill, were at last fraternising with
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they rode it chanced that presently Guidobaldo fell behind, so that
      for a moment Francesco and Valentina found themselves alone a little ahead
      of the others. She turned to him, a shyness in her brown eyes, a tremble
      at the corners of her red lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not yet said that you forgive me, Francesco,&rdquo; she complained, in
      a timerous whisper. &ldquo;Were it not seemly that you did since we are to be
      wed so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
