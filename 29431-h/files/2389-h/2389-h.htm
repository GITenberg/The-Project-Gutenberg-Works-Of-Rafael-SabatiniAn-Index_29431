    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE WAGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak of the Devil,&rdquo; whispered La Fosse in my ear, and, moved by the
      words and by the significance of his glance, I turned in my chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      1The door had opened, and under the lintel stood the thick-set figure of
      the Comte de Chatellerault. Before him a lacquey in my escutcheoned livery
      of red-and-gold was receiving, with back obsequiously bent, his hat and
      cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden hush fell upon the assembly where a moment ago this very man had
      been the subject of our talk, and silenced were the wits that but an
      instant since had been making free with his name and turning the Languedoc
      courtship&mdash;from which he was newly returned with the shame of defeat&mdash;into
      a subject for heartless mockery and jest. Surprise was in the air for we
      had heard that Chatellerault was crushed by his ill-fortune in the lists
      of Cupid, and we had not looked to see him joining so soon a board at
      which&mdash;or so at least I boasted&mdash;mirth presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for a little space the Count stood pausing on my threshold, whilst
      we craned our necks to contemplate him as though he had been an object for
      inquisitive inspection. Then a smothered laugh from the brainless La Fosse
      seemed to break the spell. I frowned. It was a climax of discourtesy whose
      impression I must at all costs efface.
    </p>
    <p>
      I leapt to my feet, with a suddenness that sent my chair gliding a full
      half-yard along the glimmering parquet of the floor, and in two strides I
      had reached the Count and put forth my hand to bid him welcome. He took it
      with a leisureliness that argued sorrow. He advanced into the full blaze
      of the candlelight, and fetched a dismal sigh from the depths of his
      portly bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are surprised to see me, Monsieur le Marquis,&rdquo; said he, and his tone
      seemed to convey an apology for his coming&mdash;for his very existence
      almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Nature had made my Lord of Chatellerault as proud and arrogant as
      Lucifer&mdash;some resemblance to which illustrious personage his
      downtrodden retainers were said to detect in the lineaments of his swarthy
      face. Environment had added to that store of insolence wherewith Nature
      had equipped him, and the King&rsquo;s favour&mdash;in which he was my rival&mdash;had
      gone yet further to mould the peacock attributes of his vain soul. So that
      this wondrous humble tone of his gave me pause; for to me it seemed that
      not even a courtship gone awry could account for it in such a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not thought to find so many here,&rdquo; said he. And his next words
      contained the cause of his dejected air. &ldquo;The King, Monsieur de Bardelys,
      has refused to see me; and when the sun is gone, we lesser bodies of the
      courtly firmament must needs turn for light and comfort to the moon.&rdquo; And
      he made me a sweeping bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning that I rule the night?&rdquo; quoth I, and laughed. &ldquo;The figure is more
      playful than exact, for whilst the moon is cold and cheerless, me you
      shall find ever warm and cordial. I could have wished, Monsieur de
      Chatellerault, that your gracing my board were due to a circumstance less
      untoward than His Majesty&rsquo;s displeasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not for nothing that they call you the Magnificent,&rdquo; he answered,
      with a fresh bow, insensible to the sting in the tail of my honeyed words.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and, setting compliments to rest with that, I led him to the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganymede, a place here for Monsieur le Comte. Gilles, Antoine, see to
      Monsieur de Chatellerault. Basile, wine for Monsieur le Comte. Bestir
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he was become the centre of a very turmoil of attention. My
      lacqueys flitted about him buzzing and insistent as bees about a rose.
      Would Monsieur taste of this capon a la casserole, or of this truffled
      peacock? Would a slice of this juicy ham a l&rsquo;anglaise tempt Monsieur le
      Comte, or would he give himself the pain of trying this turkey aux olives?
      Here was a salad whose secret Monsieur le Marquis&rsquo;s cook had learnt in
      Italy, and here a vol-au-vent that was invented by Quelon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basile urged his wines upon him, accompanied by a page who bore a silver
      tray laden with beakers and Wagons. Would Monsieur le Comte take white
      Armagnac or red Anjou? This was a Burgundy of which Monsieur le Marquis
      thought highly, and this a delicate Lombardy wine that His Majesty had oft
      commended. Or perhaps Monsieur de Chatellerault would prefer to taste the
      last vintage of Bardelys?
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they plagued him and bewildered him until his choice was made; and
      even then a couple of them held themselves in readiness behind his chair
      to forestall his slightest want. Indeed, had he been the very King
      himself, no greater honour could we have shown him at the Hotel de
      Bardelys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the restraint that his coming had brought with it hung still upon the
      company, for Chatellerault was little loved, and his presence there was
      much as that of the skull at an Egyptian banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For of all these fair-weather friends that sat about my table&mdash;amongst
      whom there were few that had not felt his power&mdash;I feared there might
      be scarcely one would have the grace to dissemble his contempt of the
      fallen favourite. That he was fallen, as much his words as what already we
      had known, had told us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in my house I would strive that he should have no foretaste of that
      coldness that to-morrow all Paris would be showing him, and to this end I
      played the host with all the graciousness that role may bear, and
      overwhelmed him with my cordiality, whilst to thaw all iciness from the
      bearing of my other guests, I set the wines to flow more freely still. My
      dignity would permit no less of me, else would it have seemed that I
      rejoiced in a rival&rsquo;s downfall and took satisfaction from the circumstance
      that his disfavour with the King was like to result in my own further
      exaltation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My efforts were not wasted. Slowly the mellowing influence of the grape
      pronounced itself. To this influence I added that of such wit as Heaven
      has graced me with, and by a word here and another there I set myself to
      lash their mood back into the joviality out of which his coming had for
      the moment driven it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, presently, Good-Humour spread her mantle over us anew, and quip
      and jest and laughter decked our speech, until the noise of our
      merry-making drifting out through the open windows must have been borne
      upon the breeze of that August night down the rue Saint-Dominique, across
      the rue de l&rsquo;Enfer, to the very ears perhaps of those within the
      Luxembourg, telling them that Bardelys and his friends kept another of
      those revels which were become a byword in Paris, and had contributed not
      a little to the sobriquet of &ldquo;Magnificent&rdquo; which men gave me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, later, as the toasts grew wild and were pledged less for the sake of
      the toasted than for that of the wine itself, wits grew more barbed and
      less restrained by caution; recklessness hung a moment, like a bird of
      prey, above us, then swooped abruptly down in the words of that fool La
      Fosse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs,&rdquo; he lisped, with that fatuousness he affected, and with his
      eye fixed coldly upon Chatellerault, &ldquo;I have a toast for you.&rdquo; He rose
      carefully to his feet&mdash;he had arrived at that condition in which to
      move with care is of the first importance. He shifted his eye from the
      Count to his glass, which stood half empty. He signed to a lacquey to fill
      it. &ldquo;To the brim, gentlemen,&rdquo; he commanded. Then, in the silence that
      ensued, he attempted to stand with one foot on the ground and one on his
      chair; but encountering difficulties of balance, he remained upright&mdash;safer
      if less picturesque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, I give you the most peerless, the most beautiful, the most
      difficult and cold lady in all France. I drink to those her thousand
      graces, of which Fame has told us, and to that greatest and most vexing
      charm of all&mdash;her cold indifference to man. I pledge you, too, the
      swain whose good fortune it maybe to play Endymion to this Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will need,&rdquo; pursued La Fosse, who dealt much in mythology and classic
      lore&mdash;&ldquo;it will need an Adonis in beauty, a Mars in valour, an Apollo
      in song, and a very Eros in love to accomplish it. And I fear me,&rdquo; he
      hiccoughed, &ldquo;that it will go unaccomplished, since the one man in all
      France on whom we have based our hopes has failed. Gentlemen, to your
      feet! I give you the matchless Roxalanne de Lavedan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such amusement as I felt was tempered by apprehension. I shot a swift
      glance at Chatellerault to mark how he took this pleasantry and this
      pledging of the lady whom the King had sent him to woo, but whom he had
      failed to win. He had risen with the others at La Fosse&rsquo;s bidding, either
      unsuspicious or else deeming suspicion too flimsy a thing by which to
      steer conduct. Yet at the mention of her name a scowl darkened his
      ponderous countenance. He set down his glass with such sudden force that
      its slender stem was snapped and a red stream of wine streaked the white
      tablecloth and spread around a silver flowerbowl. The sight of that stain
      recalled him to himself and to the manners he had allowed himself for a
      moment to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bardelys, a thousand apologies for my clumsiness,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spilt wine,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;is a good omen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for once I accepted that belief, since but for the shedding of that
      wine and its sudden effect upon him, it is likely we had witnessed a
      shedding of blood. Thus, was the ill-timed pleasantry of my
      feather-brained La Fosse tided over in comparative safety. But the topic
      being raised was not so easily abandoned. Mademoiselle de Lavedan grew to
      be openly discussed, and even the Count&rsquo;s courtship of her came to be
      hinted at, at first vaguely, then pointedly, with a lack of delicacy for
      which I can but blame the wine with which these gentlemen had made a salad
      of their senses. In growing alarm I watched the Count. But he showed no
      further sign of irritation. He sat and listened as though no jot
      concerned. There were moments when he even smiled at some lively sally,
      and at last he went so far as to join in that merry combat of wits, and
      defend himself from their attacks, which were made with a good-humour that
      but thinly veiled the dislike he was held in and the satisfaction that was
      culled from his late discomfiture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while I hung back and took no share in the banter that was toward.
      But in the end&mdash;lured perhaps by the spirit in which I have shown
      that Chatellerault accepted it, and lulled by the wine which in common
      with my guests I may have abused&mdash;I came to utter words but for which
      this story never had been written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatellerault,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;abandon these defensive subterfuges; confess
      that you are but uttering excuses, and acknowledge that you have conducted
      this affair with a clumsiness unpardonable in one equipped with your
      advantages of courtly rearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush overspread his face, the first sign of anger since he had spilled
      his wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your successes, Bardelys, render you vain, and of vanity is presumption
      born,&rdquo; he replied contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; I cried, appealing to the company. &ldquo;Observe how he seeks to evade
      replying! Nay, but you shall confess your clumsiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clumsiness,&rdquo; murmured La Fosse drowsily, &ldquo;as signal as that which
      attended Pan&rsquo;s wooing of the Queen of Lydia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no clumsiness to confess,&rdquo; he answered hotly, raising his voice.
      &ldquo;It is a fine thing to sit here in Paris, among the languid, dull, and
      nerveless beauties of the Court, whose favours are easily won because they
      look on dalliance as the best pastime offered them, and are eager for such
      opportunities of it as you fleering coxcombs will afford them. But this
      Mademoiselle de Lavedan is of a vastly different mettle. She is a woman;
      not a doll. She is flesh and blood; not sawdust, powder, and vermilion.
      She has a heart and a will; not a spirit corrupted by vanity and licence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Fosse burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! O, hark!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;to the apostle of the chaste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Gris!&rdquo; exclaimed another. &ldquo;This good Chatellerault has lost both
      heart and head to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatellerault glanced at the speaker with an eye in which anger
      smouldered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said it,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;He has fallen her victim, and so his vanity
      translates her into a compound of perfections. Does such a woman as you
      have described exist, Comte? Bah! In a lover&rsquo;s mind, perhaps, or in the
      pages of some crack-brained poet&rsquo;s fancies; but nowhere else in this dull
      world of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been clumsy, Chatellerault,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lacked address. The woman does not live that is not to be won by
      any man who sets his mind to do it, if only he be of her station and have
      the means to maintain her in it or raise her to a better. A woman&rsquo;s love,
      sir, is a tree whose root is vanity. Your attentions flatter her, and
      predispose her to capitulate. Then, if you but wisely choose your time to
      deliver the attack, and do so with the necessary adroitness&mdash;nor is
      overmuch demanded&mdash;the battle is won with ease, and she surrenders.
      Believe me, Chatellerault, I am a younger man than you by full five years,
      yet in experience I am a generation older, and I talk of what I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sneered heavily. &ldquo;If to have begun your career of dalliance at the age
      of eighteen with an amour that resulted in a scandal be your title to
      experience, I agree,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But for the rest, Bardelys, for all your
      fine talk of conquering women, believe me when I tell you that in all your
      life you have never met a woman, for I deny the claim of these Court
      creatures to that title. If you would know a woman, go to Lavedan,
      Monsieur le Marquis. If you would have your army of amorous wiles suffer a
      defeat at last, go employ it against the citadel of Roxalanne de Lavedan&rsquo;s
      heart. If you would be humbled in your pride, betake yourself to Lavedan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A challenge!&rdquo; roared a dozen voices. &ldquo;A challenge, Bardelys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais voyons,&rdquo; I deprecated, with a laugh, &ldquo;would you have me journey into
      Languedoc and play at wooing this embodiment of all the marvels of
      womanhood for the sake of making good my argument? Of your charity,
      gentlemen, insist no further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The never-failing excuse of the boaster,&rdquo; sneered Chatellerault, &ldquo;when
      desired to make good his boast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur conceives that I have made a boast?&rdquo; quoth I, keeping my temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words suggested one&mdash;else I do not know the meaning of words.
      They suggested that where I have failed you could succeed, if you had a
      mind to try. I have challenged you, Bardelys. I challenge you again. Go
      about this wooing as you will; dazzle the lady with your wealth and your
      magnificence, with your servants, your horses, your equipages; and all the
      splendours you can command; yet I make bold to say that not a year of your
      scented attentions and most insidious wiles will bear you fruit. Are you
      sufficiently challenged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is rank frenzy!&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;Why should I undertake this
      thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To prove me wrong,&rdquo; he taunted me. &ldquo;To prove me clumsy. Come, Bardelys,
      what of your spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I would do much to afford you the proof you ask. But to take a
      wife! Pardi! That is much indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;You do well to draw back You are wise to avoid
      discomfiture. This lady is not for you. When she is won, it will be by
      some bold and gallant gentleman, and by no mincing squire of dames, no
      courtly coxcomb, no fop of the Luxembourg, be his experiences of dalliance
      never so vast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po&rsquo; Cap de Dieu!&rdquo; growled Cazalet, who was a Gascon captain in the
      Guards, and who swore strange, southern oaths. &ldquo;Up, Bardelys! Afoot! Prove
      your boldness and your gallantry, or be forever shamed; a squire of dames,
      a courtly coxcomb, a fop of the Luxembourg! Mordemondieu! I have given a
      man a bellyful of steel for the half of those titles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heeded him little, and as little the other noisy babblers, who now on
      their feet&mdash;those that could stand&mdash;were spurring me excitedly
      to accept the challenge, until from being one of the baiters it seemed
      that of a sudden the tables were turned and I was become the baited. I sat
      in thought, revolving the business in my mind, and frankly liking it but
      little. Doubts of the issue, were I to undertake it, I had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      My views of the other sex were neither more nor less than my words to the
      Count had been calculated to convey. It may be&mdash;I know now that it
      was that the women I had known fitted Chatellerault&rsquo;s description, and
      were not over-difficult to win. Hence, such successes as I had had with
      them in such comedies of love as I had been engaged upon had given me a
      false impression. But such at least was not my opinion that night. I was
      satisfied that Chatellerault talked wildly, and that no such woman lived
      as he depicted. Cynical and soured you may account me. Such I know I was
      accounted in Paris; a man satiated with all that wealth and youth and the
      King&rsquo;s favour could give him; stripped of illusions, of faith and of zest,
      the very magnificence&mdash;so envied&mdash;of my existence affording me
      more disgust than satisfaction. Since already I had gauged its shallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it strange, therefore, that in this challenge flung at me with such
      insistence, a business that at first I disliked grew presently to beckon
      me with its novelty and its promise of new sensations?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your spirit dead, Monsieur de Bardelys?&rdquo; Chatellerault was gibing,
      when my silence had endured some moments. &ldquo;Is the cock that lately crowed
      so lustily now dumb? Look you, Monsieur le Marquis, you are accounted here
      a reckless gamester. Will a wager induce you to this undertaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I leapt to my feet at that. His derision cut me like a whip. If what I did
      was the act of a braggart, yet it almost seems I could do no less to
      bolster up my former boasting&mdash;or what into boasting they had
      translated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lay a wager, will you, Chatellerault?&rdquo; I cried, giving him back
      defiance for defiance. A breathless silence fell. &ldquo;Then have it so.
      Listen, gentlemen, that you may be witnesses. I do here pledge my castle
      of Bardelys, and my estates in Picardy, with every stick and stone and
      blade of grass that stands upon them, that I shall woo and win Roxalanne
      de Lavedan to be the Marquise of Bardelys. Does the stake satisfy you,
      Monsieur le Comte? You may set all you have against it,&rdquo; I added coarsely,
      &ldquo;and yet, I swear, the odds will be heavily in your favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remember it was Mironsac who first found his tongue, and sought even at
      that late hour to set restraint upon us and to bring judgment to our aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, messieurs!&rdquo; he besought us. &ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, bethink you
      what you do. Bardelys, your wager is a madness. Monsieur de Chatellerault,
      you&rsquo;ll not accept it. You&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent,&rdquo; I rebuked him, with some asperity. &ldquo;What has Monsieur de
      Chatellerault to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was staring at the tablecloth and the stain of the wine that he had
      spilled when first Mademoiselle de Lavedan&rsquo;s name was mentioned. His head
      had been bent so that his long black hair had tumbled forward and partly
      veiled his face. At my question he suddenly looked up. The ghost of a
      smile hung on his sensuous lips, for all that excitement had paled his
      countenance beyond its habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Marquis.&rdquo; said he rising, &ldquo;I take your wager, and I pledge my
      lands in Normandy against yours of Bardelys. Should you lose, they will no
      longer call you the Magnificent; should I lose&mdash;I shall be a beggar.
      It is a momentous wager, Bardelys, and spells ruin for one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A madness!&rdquo; groaned Mironsac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mordieux!&rdquo; swore Cazalet. Whilst La Fosse, who had been the original
      cause of all this trouble, vented his excitement in a gibber of imbecile
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you give me, Chatellerault?&rdquo; I asked, as quietly as I might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time shall you require?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer that you name the limit,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered a moment. Then &ldquo;Will three months suffice you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is not done in three months, I will pay,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Chatellerault did what after all was, I suppose, the only thing
      that a gentleman might do under the circumstances. He rose to his feet,
      and, bidding the company charge their glasses, he gave them a parting
      toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs, drink with me to Monsieur le Marquis de Bardelys&rsquo;s safe
      journey into Languedoc, and to the prospering of his undertaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer, a great shout went up from throats that suspense had lately
      held in leash. Men leapt on to their chairs, and, holding their glasses on
      high, they acclaimed me as thunderously as though I had been the hero of
      some noble exploit, instead of the main figure in a somewhat questionable
      wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bardelys!&rdquo; was the shout with which the house reechoed. &ldquo;Bardelys!
      Bardelys the Magnificent! Vive Bardelys!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE KING&rsquo;S WISHES
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was daybreak ere the last of them had left me, for a dozen or so had
      lingered to play lansquenet after the others had departed. With those that
      remained my wager had soon faded into insignificance, as their minds
      became engrossed in the fluctuations of their own fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not play myself; I was not in the mood, and for one night, at least,
      of sufficient weight already I thought the game upon which I was launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was out on the balcony as the first lines of dawn were scoring the east,
      and in a moody, thoughtful condition I had riveted my eyes upon the palace
      of the Luxembourg, which loomed a black pile against the lightening sky,
      when Mironsac came out to join me. A gentle, lovable lad was Mironsac, not
      twenty years of age, and with the face and manners of a woman. That he was
      attached to me I knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Marquis,&rdquo; said he softly, &ldquo;I am desolated at this wager into
      which they have forced you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forced me?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;No, no; they did not force me. And yet,&rdquo; I
      reflected, with a sigh, &ldquo;perhaps they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking, monsieur, that if the King were to hear of it the
      evil might be mended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the King must not hear of it, Armand,&rdquo; I answered quickly. &ldquo;Even if
      he did, matters would be no better&mdash;much worse, possibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur, this thing done in the heat of wine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is none the less done, Armand,&rdquo; I concluded. &ldquo;And I for one do not wish
      it undone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you no thought for the lady?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at him. &ldquo;Were I still eighteen, boy, the thought might trouble
      me. Had I my illusions, I might imagine that my wife must be some woman of
      whom I should be enamoured. As it is, I have grown to the age of
      twenty-eight unwed. Marriage becomes desirable. I must think of an heir to
      all the wealth of Bardelys. And so I go to Languedoc. If the lady be but
      half the saint that fool Chatellerault has painted her, so much the better
      for my children; if not, so much the worse. There is the dawn, Mironsac,
      and it is time we were abed. Let us drive these plaguy gamesters home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the last of them had staggered down my steps, and I had bidden a
      drowsy lacquey extinguish the candles, I called Ganymede to light me to
      bed and aid me to undress. His true name was Rodenard; but my friend La
      Fosse, of mythological fancy, had named him Ganymede, after the cup-bearer
      of the gods, and the name had clung to him. He was a man of some forty
      years of age, born into my father&rsquo;s service, and since become my
      intendant, factotum, majordomo, and generalissimo of my regiment of
      servants and my establishments both in Paris and at Bardelys.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had been to the wars together ere I had cut my wisdom teeth, and thus
      had he come to love me. There was nothing this invaluable servant could
      not do. At baiting or shoeing a horse, at healing a wound, at roasting a
      capon, or at mending a doublet, he was alike a master, besides possessing
      a score of other accomplishments that do not now occur to me, which in his
      campaigning he had acquired. Of late the easy life in Paris had made him
      incline to corpulency, and his face was of a pale, unhealthy fullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night, as he assisted me to undress, it wore an expression of supreme
      woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur is going into Languedoc?&rdquo; he inquired sorrowfully. He always
      called me his &ldquo;seigneur,&rdquo; as did the other of my servants born at
      Bardelys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knave, you have been listening,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monseigneur,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;when Monsieur le Comte de Chatellerault
      laid his wager&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have I not told you, Ganymede, that when you chance to be among my
      friends you should hear nothing but the words addressed to you, see
      nothing but the glasses that need replenishing? But, there! We are going
      into Languedoc. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that war may break out at any moment,&rdquo; he groaned; &ldquo;that
      Monsieur le Duc de Montmorency is receiving reenforcements from Spain, and
      that he intends to uphold the standard of Monsieur and the rights of the
      province against the encroachments of His Eminence the Cardinal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! We are becoming politicians, eh, Ganymede? And how shall all this
      concern us? Had you listened more attentively, you had learnt that we go
      to Languedoc to seek a wife, and not to concern ourselves with Cardinals
      and Dukes. Now let me sleep ere the sun rises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow I attended the levee, and I applied to His Majesty for leave
      to absent myself. But upon hearing that it was into Languedoc I went, he
      frowned inquiry. Trouble enough was his brother already making in that
      province. I explained that I went to seek a wife, and deeming all
      subterfuge dangerous, since it might only serve to provoke him when later
      he came to learn the lady&rsquo;s name, I told him&mdash;withholding yet all
      mention of the wager&mdash;that I fostered the hope of making Mademoiselle
      de Lavedan my marquise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeper came the line between his brows at that, and blacker grew the
      scowl. He was not wont to bestow on me such looks as I now met in his
      weary eyes, for Louis XIII had much affection for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know this lady?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by name, Your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that his brows went up in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by name? And you would wed her? But, Marcel, my friend, you are a
      rich man one of the richest in France. You cannot be a fortune hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Fame sings loudly the praises of this lady, her
      beauty and her virtue&mdash;praises that lead me to opine she would make
      me an excellent chatelaine. I am come to an age when it is well to wed;
      indeed, Your Majesty has often told me so. And it seems to me that all
      France does not hold a lady more desirable. Heaven send she will agree to
      my suit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that tired way of his that was so pathetic: &ldquo;Do you love me a little,
      Marcel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; I exclaimed, wondering whither all this was leading us, &ldquo;need I
      protest it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered dryly; &ldquo;you can prove it. Prove it by abandoning this
      Languedoc quest. I have motives&mdash;sound motives, motives of political
      import. I desire another wedding for Mademoiselle de Lavedan. I wish it
      so, Bardelys, and I look to be obeyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment temptation had me by the throat. Here was an unlooked-for
      chance to shake from me a business which reflection was already rendering
      odious. I had but to call together my friends of yesternight, and with
      them the Comte de Chatellerault, and inform them that by the King was I
      forbidden to go awooing Roxalanne de Lavedan. So should my wager be
      dissolved. And then in a flash I saw how they would sneer one and all, and
      how they would think that I had caught avidly at this opportunity of
      freeing myself from an undertaking into which a boastful mood had lured
      me. The fear of that swept aside my momentary hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; I answered, bending my head contritely, &ldquo;I am desolated that my
      inclinations should run counter to your wishes, but to your wonted
      kindness and clemency I must look for forgiveness if these same
      inclinations drive me so relentlessly that I may not now turn back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught me viciously by the arm and looked sharply into my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You defy me, Bardelys?&rdquo; he asked, in a voice of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid, Sire!&rdquo; I answered quickly. &ldquo;I do but pursue my destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a turn in silence, like a man who is mastering himself before he
      will speak. Many an eye, I knew, was upon us, and not a few may have been
      marvelling whether already Bardelys were about to share the fate that
      yesterday had overtaken his rival Chatellerault. At last he halted at my
      side again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcel,&rdquo; said he, but though he used that name his voice was harsh, &ldquo;go
      home and ponder what I have said. If you value my favour, if you desire my
      love, you will abandon this journey and the suit you contemplate. If, on
      the other hand, you persist in going&mdash;you need not return. The Court
      of France has no room for gentlemen who are but lip-servers, no place for
      courtiers who disobey their King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was his last word. He waited for no reply, but swung round on his
      heel, and an instant later I beheld him deep in conversation with the Duke
      of Saint-Simon. Of such a quality is the love of princes&mdash;vain,
      capricious, and wilful. Indulge it ever and at any cost, else you forfeit
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned away with a sigh, for in spite of all his weaknesses and
      meannesses I loved this cardinal-ridden king, and would have died for him
      had the need occurred, as well he knew. But in this matter&mdash;well, I
      accounted my honour involved, and there was now no turning back save by
      the payment of my wager and the acknowledgment of defeat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. RENE DE LESPERON
    </h2>
    <p>
      That very day I set out. For since the King was opposed to the affair, and
      knowing the drastic measures by which he was wont to enforce what he
      desired, I realized that did I linger he might find a way definitely to
      prevent my going.
    </p>
    <p>
      I travelled in a coach, attended by two lacqueys and a score of
      men-at-arms in my own livery, all commanded by Ganymede. My intendant
      himself came in another coach with my wardrobe and travelling necessaries.
      We were a fine and almost regal cortege as we passed down the rue de
      l&rsquo;Enfer and quitted Paris by the Orleans gate, taking the road south. So
      fine a cortege, indeed, that it entered my mind. His Majesty would come to
      hear of it, and, knowing my destination, send after me to bring me back.
      To evade such a possibility, I ordered a divergence to be made, and we
      struck east and into Touraine. At Pont-le-Duc, near Tours, I had a cousin
      in the Vicomte d&rsquo;Amaral, and at his chateau I arrived on the third day
      after quitting Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that was the last place where they would seek me, if to seek me they
      were inclined, I elected to remain my cousin&rsquo;s guest for fifteen days. And
      whilst I was there we had news of trouble in the South and of a rising in
      Languedoc under the Duc de Montmorency. Thus was it that when I came to
      take my leave of Amaral, he, knowing that Languedoc was my destination,
      sought ardently to keep me with him until we should learn that peace and
      order were restored in the province. But I held the trouble lightly, and
      insisted upon going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolutely, then, if by slow stages, we pursued our journey, and came at
      last to Montauban. There we lay a night at the Auberge de Navarre,
      intending to push on to Lavedan upon the morrow. My father had been on
      more than friendly terms with the Vicomte de Lavedan, and upon this I
      built my hopes of a cordial welcome and an invitation to delay for a few
      days the journey to Toulouse, upon which I should represent myself as
      bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, then, stood my plans. And they remained unaltered for all that upon
      the morrow there were wild rumours in the air of Montauban. There were
      tellings of a battle fought the day before at Castelnaudary, of the defeat
      of Monsieur&rsquo;s partisans, of the utter rout of Gonzalo de Cordova&rsquo;s Spanish
      tatterdemalions, and of the capture of Montmorency, who was sorely wounded&mdash;some
      said with twenty and some with thirty wounds&mdash;and little like to
      live. Sorrow and discontent stalked abroad in Languedoc that day, for they
      believed that it was against the Cardinal, who sought to strip them of so
      many privileges, that Gaston d&rsquo;Orleans had set up his standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      That those rumours of battle and defeat were true we had ample proof some
      few hours later, when a company of dragoons in buff and steel rode into
      the courtyard of the Auberge de Navarre, headed by a young spark of an
      officer, who confirmed the rumour and set the number of Montmorency&rsquo;s
      wounds at seventeen. He was lying, the officer told us, at Castelnaudary,
      and his duchess was hastening to him from Beziers. Poor woman! She was
      destined to nurse him back to life and vigour only that he might take his
      trial at Toulouse and pay with his head the price of his rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ganymede who, through the luxurious habits of his more recent years had&mdash;for
      all his fine swagger&mdash;developed a marked distaste for warfare and
      excitement, besought me to take thought for my safety and to lie quietly
      at Montauban until the province should be more settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place is a hotbed of rebellion,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;If these Chouans but
      learn that we are from Paris and of the King&rsquo;s party, we shall have our
      throats slit, as I live. There is not a peasant in all this countryside
      indeed, scarce a man of any sort but is a red-hot Orleanist,
      anti-Cardinalist, and friend of the Devil. Bethink you, monseigneur, to
      push on at the present is to court murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, we will court murder,&rdquo; said I coldly. &ldquo;Give the word to
      saddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked him at the moment of setting out did he know the road to Lavedan,
      to which the lying poltroon made answer that he did. In his youth he may
      have known it, and the countryside may have undergone since then such
      changes as bewildered him. Or it may be that fear dulled his wits, and
      lured him into taking what may have seemed the safer rather than the
      likelier road. But this I know, that as night was falling my carriage
      halted with a lurch, and as I put forth my head I was confronted by my
      trembling intendant, his great fat face gleaming whitely in the gloom
      above the lawn collar on his doublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do we halt, Ganymede?&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he faltered, his trembling increasing as he spoke, and his
      eyes meeting mine in a look of pitiful contrition, &ldquo;I fear we are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;Of what do you talk? Am I to sleep in the coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, monseigneur, I have done my best&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, God keep us from your worst,&rdquo; I snapped. &ldquo;Open me this door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stepped down and looked about me, and, by my faith, a more desolate spot
      to lose us in my henchman could not have contrived had he been at pains to
      do so. A bleak, barren landscape&mdash;such as I could hardly have
      credited was to be found in all that fair province&mdash;unfolded itself,
      looking now more bleak, perhaps, by virtue of the dim evening mist that
      hovered over it. Yonder, to the right, a dull russet patch of sky marked
      the west, and then in front of us I made out the hazy outline of the
      Pyrenees. At sight of them, I swung round and gripped my henchman by the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fine trusty servant thou!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Boaster! Had you told us that age
      and fat living had so stunted your wits as to have extinguished memory, I
      had taken a guide at Montauban to show us the way. Yet, here, with the sun
      and the Pyrenees to guide you, even had you no other knowledge, you lose
      yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he whimpered, &ldquo;I was choosing my way by the sun and the
      mountains, and it was thus that I came to this impasse. For you may see,
      yourself, that the road ends here abruptly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganymede,&rdquo; said I slowly, &ldquo;when we return to Paris&mdash;if you do not
      die of fright &lsquo;twixt this and then&mdash;I&rsquo;ll find a place for you in the
      kitchens. God send you may make a better scullion than a follower!&rdquo; Then,
      vaulting over the wall, &ldquo;Attend me, some half-dozen of you,&rdquo; I commanded,
      and stepped out briskly towards the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weather-beaten old door creaked upon its rusty hinges, we were
      greeted by a groan from within, and with it the soft rustle of straw that
      is being moved. Surprised, I halted, and waited whilst one of my men
      kindled a light in the lanthorn that he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      By its rays we beheld a pitiable sight in a corner of that building. A
      man, quite young and of a tall and vigorous frame, lay stretched upon the
      straw. He was fully dressed even to his great riding-boots, and from the
      loose manner in which his back-and-breast hung now upon him, it would seem
      as if he had been making shift to divest himself of his armour, but had
      lacked the strength to complete the task. Beside him lay a feathered
      headpiece and a sword attached to a richly broidered baldrick. All about
      him the straw was clotted with brown, viscous patches of blood. The
      doublet which had been of sky-blue velvet was all sodden and stained, and
      inspection showed us that he had been wounded in the right side, between
      the straps of his breastplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we stood about him now, a silent, pitying group, appearing fantastic,
      perhaps, by the dim light of that single lanthorn, he attempted to raise
      his head, and then with a groan he dropped it back upon the straw that
      pillowed it. From out of a face white, as in death, and drawn with haggard
      lines of pain, a pair of great lustrous blue eyes were turned upon us,
      abject and pitiful as the gaze of a dumb beast that is stricken mortally.
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed no acuteness to apprehend that we had before us one of
      yesterday&rsquo;s defeated warriors; one who had spent his last strength in
      creeping hither to get his dying done in peace. Lest our presence should
      add fear to the agony already upon him, I knelt beside him in the
      blood-smeared straw, and, raising his head, I pillowed it upon my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said I reassuringly. &ldquo;We are friends. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faint smile that played for a second on his lips and lighted his
      countenance would have told me that he understood, even had I not caught
      his words, faint as a sigh &ldquo;Merci, monsieur.&rdquo; He nestled his head into the
      crook of my arm. &ldquo;Water&mdash;for the love of God!&rdquo; he gasped, to add in a
      groan, &ldquo;Je me meurs, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Assisted by a couple of knaves, Ganymede went about attending to the rebel
      at once. Handling him as carefully as might be, to avoid giving him
      unnecessary pain they removed his back-and-breast, which was flung with a
      clatter into one of the corners of the barn. Then, whilst one of them
      gently drew off his boots, Rodenard, with the lanthorn close beside him,
      cut away the fellow&rsquo;s doublet, and laid bare the oozing sword-wound that
      gaped in his mangled side. He whispered an order to Gilles, who went
      swiftly off to the coach in quest of something that he had asked for; then
      he sat on his heels and waited, his hand upon the man&rsquo;s pulse, his eyes on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stooped until my lips were on a level with my intendant&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it with him?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dying,&rdquo; whispered Rodenard in answer. &ldquo;He has lost too much blood, and he
      is probably bleeding inwardly as well. There is no hope of his life, but
      he may linger thus some little while, sinking gradually, and we can at
      least mitigate the suffering of his last moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When presently the men returned with the things that Ganymede had asked
      for, he mixed some pungent liquid with water, and, whilst a servant held
      the bowl, he carefully sponged the rebel&rsquo;s wound. This and a cordial that
      he had given him to drink seemed to revive him and to afford him ease. His
      breathing was no longer marked by any rasping sound, and his eyes seemed
      to burn more intelligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dying&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo; he asked, and Ganymede bowed his head in
      silence. The poor fellow sighed. &ldquo;Raise me,&rdquo; he begged, and when this
      service had been done him, his eyes wandered round until they found me.
      Then &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you do me a last favour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly, my poor friend,&rdquo; I answered, going down on my knees beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you were not for the Duke?&rdquo; he inquired, eyeing me more keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur. But do not let that disturb you; I have no interest in this
      rising and I have taken no side. I am from Paris, on a journey of&mdash;of
      pleasure. My name is Bardelys&mdash;Marcel de Bardelys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bardelys the Magnificent?&rdquo; he questioned, and I could not repress a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am that overrated man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then you are for the King!&rdquo; And a note of disappointment crept into
      his voice. Before I could make him any answer, he had resumed. &ldquo;No matter;
      Marcel de Bardelys is a gentleman, and party signifies little when a man
      is dying. I am Rene de Lesperon, of Lesperon in Gascony,&rdquo; he pursued.
      &ldquo;Will you send word to my sister afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed my head without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the only relative I have, monsieur. But&rdquo;&mdash;and his tone grew
      wistful&mdash;&ldquo;there is one other to whom I would have you bear a
      message.&rdquo; He raised his hand by a painful effort to the level of his
      breast. Strength failed him, and he sank back. &ldquo;I cannot, monsieur,&rdquo; he
      said in a tone of pathetic apology. &ldquo;See; there is a chain about my neck
      with a locket. Take it from me. Take it now, monsieur. There are some
      papers also, monsieur. Take all. I want to see them safely in your
      keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did his bidding, and from the breast of his doublet I drew some loose
      letters and a locket which held the miniature of a woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to deliver all to her, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; I answered, deeply moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold it&mdash;hold it up,&rdquo; he begged, his voice weakening. &ldquo;Let me behold
      the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Long his eyes rested on the likeness I held before him. At last, as one in
      a dream&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-beloved,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Bien aimee!&rdquo; And down his grey, haggard cheeks
      the tears came slowly. &ldquo;Forgive this weakness, monsieur,&rdquo; he whispered
      brokenly. &ldquo;We were to have been wed in a month, had I lived.&rdquo; He ended
      with a sob, and when next he spoke it was more labouredly, as though that
      sob had robbed him of the half of what vitality remained. &ldquo;Tell her,
      monsieur, that my dying thoughts were of her. Tell&mdash;tell her&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name?&rdquo; I cried, fearing he would sink before I learned it. &ldquo;Tell me
      her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me with eyes that were growing glassy and vacant. Then he
      seemed to brace himself and to rally for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name?&rdquo; he mused, in a far-off manner. &ldquo;She is&mdash;Ma-de-moiselle de
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His head rolled on the suddenly relaxed neck. He collapsed into Rodenard&rsquo;s
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodenard nodded in silence.

      CHAPTER IV. A MAID IN THE MOONLIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      I do not know whether it was the influence of that thing lying in a corner
      of the barn under the cloak that Rodenard had flung over it, or whether
      other influences of destiny were at work to impel me to rise at the end of
      a half-hour and announce my determination to set out on horseback and find
      myself quarters more congenial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; I instructed Ganymede, as I stood ready to mount, &ldquo;you will
      retrace your steps with the others, and, finding the road to Lavedan, you
      will follow me to the chateau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot hope to reach it to-night, monseigneur, through a country
      that is unknown to you,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not hope to reach it to-night. I will ride south until I come upon
      some hamlet that will afford me shelter and, in the morning, direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I left him with that, and set out at a brisk trot. Night had now fallen,
      but the sky was clear, and a crescent moon came opportunely if feebly to
      dispel the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I quitted the field, and went back until I gained a crossroad, where,
      turning to the right, I set my face to the Pyrenees, and rode briskly
      amain. That I had chosen wisely was proved when some twenty minutes later.
      I clattered into the hamlet of Mirepoix, and drew up before an inn
      flaunting the sign of a peacock&mdash;as if in irony of its humbleness,
      for it was no better than a wayside tavern. Neither stable-boy nor ostler
      was here, and the unclean, overgrown urchin to whom I entrusted my horse
      could not say whether indeed Pere Abdon the landlord would be able to find
      me a room to sleep in. I thirsted, however; and so I determined to alight,
      if it were only to drink a can of wine and obtain information of my
      whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was entering the hostelry there was a clatter of hoofs in the street,
      and four dragoons headed by a sergeant rode up and halted at the door of
      the Paon. They seemed to have ridden hard and some distance, for their
      horses were jaded almost to the last point of endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, I called the host, and having obtained a flagon of the best
      vintage&mdash;Heaven fortify those that must be content with his worst!&mdash;I
      passed on to make inquiries touching my whereabouts and the way to
      Lavedan. This I learnt was but some three or four miles distant. About the
      other table&mdash;there were but two within the room&mdash;stood the
      dragoons in a whispered consultation, of which it had been well had I
      taken heed, for it concerned me more closely than I could have dreamt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He answers the description,&rdquo; said the sergeant, and though I heard the
      words I took no thought that it was of me they spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Padrieu,&rdquo; swore one of his companions, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager it is our man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, just as I was noticing that Master Abdon, who had also overheard
      the conversation, was eyeing me curiously, the sergeant stepped up to me,
      and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, monsieur?&rdquo; quoth he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I vouchsafed him a stare of surprise before asking in my turn &ldquo;How may
      that concern you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, my master, but we are on the King&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I remembered then that he had said I answered some description. With that
      it flashed through my mind that they had been sent after me by His Majesty
      to enforce my obedience to his wishes and to hinder me from reaching
      Lavedan. At once came the dominant desire to conceal my identity that I
      might go unhindered. The first name that occurred to me was that of the
      poor wretch I had left in the barn half an hour ago, and so&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon, at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too late I saw the mistake that I had made. I own it was a blunder that no
      man of ordinary intelligence should have permitted himself to have
      committed. Remembering the unrest of the province, I should rather have
      concluded that their business was more like to be in that connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is bold, at least,&rdquo; cried one of the troopers, with a burst of
      laughter. Then came the sergeant&rsquo;s voice, cold and formal, &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s
      name, Monsieur de Lesperon, I arrest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had whipped out his sword, and the point was within an inch of my
      breast. But his arm, I observed, was stretched to its fullest extent,
      which forbade his making a sudden thrust. To hamper him in the lunge there
      was the table between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, my mind working quickly in this desperate situation, and realizing how
      dire and urgent the need to attempt an escape, I leapt suddenly back to
      find myself in the arms of his followers. But in moving I had caught up by
      one of its legs the stool on which I had been sitting. As I raised it, I
      eluded the pinioning grip of the troopers. I twisted in their grasp, and
      brought the stool down upon the head of one of them with a force that
      drove him to his knees. Up went that three-legged stool again, to descend
      like a thunderbolt upon the head of another. That freed me. The sergeant
      was coming up behind, but another flourish of my improvised battle-axe
      sent the two remaining soldiers apart to look to their swords. Ere they
      could draw, I had darted like a hare between them and out into the street.
      The sergeant, cursing them with horrid volubility, followed closely upon
      my heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaping as far into the roadway as I could, I turned to meet the fellow&rsquo;s
      onslaught. Using the stool as a buckler, I caught his thrust upon it. So
      violently was it delivered that the point buried itself in the wood and
      the blade snapped, leaving him a hilt and a stump of steel. I wasted no
      time in thought. Charging him wildly, I knocked him over just as the two
      unhurt dragoons came stumbling out of the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gained my horse and vaulted into the saddle. Tearing the reins from the
      urchin that held them, and driving my spurs into the beast&rsquo;s flanks, I
      went careering down the street at a gallop, gripping tightly with my
      knees, whilst the stirrups, which I had had no time to step into, flew
      wildly about my legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pistol cracked behind me; then another, and a sharp, stinging pain in
      the shoulder warned me that I was hit. But I took no heed of it then. The
      wound could not be serious, else I had already been out of the saddle, and
      it would be time enough to look to it when I had outdistanced my pursuers.
      I say my pursuers, for already there were hoofbeats behind me, and I knew
      that those gentlemen had taken to their horses. But, as you may recall, I
      had on their arrival noted the jaded condition of their cattle, whilst I
      bestrode a horse that was comparatively fresh, so that pursuit had but
      small terrors for me. Nevertheless, they held out longer, and gave me more
      to do than I had imagined would be the case. For nigh upon a half-hour I
      rode, before I could be said to have got clear of them, and then for aught
      I knew they were still following, resolved to hound me down by the aid of
      such information as they might cull upon their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was come by then to the Garonne. I drew rein beside the swiftly flowing
      stream, winding itself like a flood of glittering silver between the black
      shadows of its banks. A little while I sat there listening, and surveying
      the stately, turreted chateau that loomed, a grey, noble pile, beyond the
      water. I speculated what demesne this might be, and I realized that it was
      probably Lavedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered what I had best do, and in the end I took the resolve to swim
      the river and knock at the gates. If it were indeed Lavedan, I had but to
      announce myself, and to one of my name surely its hospitalities would be
      spread. If it were some other household, even then the name of Marcel de
      Bardelys should suffice to ensure me a welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      By spurring and coaxing, I lured my steed into the river. There is a
      proverb having it that though you may lead a horse to the water you cannot
      make him drink. It would have now applied to my case, for although I had
      brought mine to the water I could not make him swim; or, at least, I could
      not make him breast the rush of the stream. Vainly did I urge him and try
      to hold him; he plunged frantically, snorted, coughed, and struggled
      gamely, but the current was bearing us swiftly away, and his efforts
      brought us no nearer to the opposite shore. At last I slipped from his
      back, and set myself to swim beside him, leading him by the bridle. But
      even thus he proved unequal to the task of resisting the current, so that
      in the end I let him go, and swam ashore alone, hoping that he would land
      farther down, and that I might then recapture him. When, however, I had
      reached the opposite bank, and stood under the shadow of the chateau, I
      discovered that the cowardly beast had turned back, and, having scrambled
      out, was now trotting away along the path by which we had come. Having no
      mind to go after him, I resigned myself to the loss, and turned my
      attention to the mansion now before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two hundred yards from the river it raised its great square bulk
      against the background of black, star-flecked sky. From the facade before
      me down to the spot where I stood by the water, came a flight of half a
      dozen terraces, each balustraded in white marble, ending in square,
      flat-topped pillars of Florentine design. What moon there was revealed the
      quaint architecture of that stately edifice and glittered upon the
      mullioned windows. But within nothing stirred; no yellow glimmer came to
      clash with the white purity of the moonlight; no sound of man or beast
      broke the stillness of the night, for all that the hour was early. The air
      of the place was as that of some gigantic sepulchre. A little daunted by
      this all-enveloping stillness, I skirted the terraces and approached the
      house on the eastern side. Here I found an old-world drawbridge&mdash;now
      naturally in disuse&mdash;spanning a ditch fed from the main river for the
      erstwhile purposes of a moat. I crossed the bridge, and entered an
      imposing courtyard. Within this quadrangle the same silence dwelt, and
      there was the same obscurity in the windows that overlooked it. I paused,
      at a loss how to proceed, and I leaned against a buttress of the
      portcullis, what time I considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was weak from fasting, worn with hard riding, and faint from the wound
      in my shoulder, which had been the cause at least of my losing some blood.
      In addition to all this, I was shivering with the cold of my wet garments,
      and generally I must have looked as little like that Bardelys they called
      the Magnificent as you might well conceive. How, then, if I were to knock,
      should I prevail in persuading these people&mdash;whoever they might be&mdash;of
      my identity? Infinitely more had I the air of some fugitive rebel, and it
      was more than probable that I should be kept in durance to be handed over
      to my friends the dragoons, if later they came to ride that way. I was
      separated from those who knew me, and as things now stood&mdash;unless
      this were, indeed, Lavedan&mdash;it might be days before they found me
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was beginning to deplore my folly at having cut myself adrift from my
      followers in the first place, and having embroiled myself with the
      soldiers in the second; I was beginning to contemplate the wisdom of
      seeking some outhouse of this mansion wherein to lie until morning, when
      of a sudden a broad shaft of light, coming from one of the windows on the
      first floor, fell athwart the courtyard. Instinctively I crouched back
      into the shadow of my friendly buttress, and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sudden shaft of light resulted from the withdrawal of the curtains
      that masked a window. At this window, which opened outward on to a
      balcony; I now beheld&mdash;and to me it was as the vision of Beatrice may
      have been to Dante&mdash;the white figure of a woman. The moonlight bathed
      her, as in her white robe she leaned upon the parapet gazing upward into
      the empyrean. A sweet, delicate face I saw, not endowed, perhaps, with
      that exquisite balance and proportion of feature wherein they tell us
      beauty lies, but blessed with a wondrously dainty beauty all its own; a
      beauty, perhaps, as much of expression as of form; for in that gentle
      countenance was mirrored every tender grace of girlhood, all that is fresh
      and pure and virginal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I held my breath, I think, as I stood in ravished contemplation of that
      white vision. If this were Lavedan, and that the cold Roxalanne who had
      sent my bold Chatellerault back to Paris empty-handed then were my task a
      very welcome one.
    </p>
    <p>
      How little it had weighed with me that I was come to Languedoc to woo a
      woman bearing the name of Roxalanne de Lavedan I have already shown. But
      here in this same Languedoc I beheld to-night a woman whom it seemed I
      might have loved, for not in ten years&mdash;not, indeed, in all my life&mdash;had
      any face so wrought upon me and called to my nature with so strong a
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed at that child, and I thought of the women that I had known&mdash;the
      bold, bedizened beauties of a Court said to be the first in Europe. And
      then it came to me that this was no demoiselle of Lavedan, no demoiselle
      at all in fact, for the noblesse of France owned no such faces. Candour
      and purity were not to be looked for in the high-bred countenances of our
      great families; they were sometimes found in the faces of the children of
      their retainers. Yes; I had it now. This child was the daughter of some
      custodian of the demesne before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as she stood there in the moonlight, a song, sung at half-voice,
      floated down on the calm air. It was a ditty of old Provence, a melody I
      knew and loved, and if aught had been wanting to heighten the enchantment
      that already ravished me, that soft melodious voice had done it. Singing
      still, she turned and reentered the room, leaving wide the windows, so
      that faintly, as from a distance, her voice still reached me after she was
      gone from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in that hour that it came to me to cast myself upon this fair
      creature&rsquo;s mercy. Surely one so sweet and saintly to behold would take
      compassion on an unfortunate! Haply my wound and all the rest that I had
      that night endured made me dull-witted and warped my reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      With what strength I still possessed I went to work to scale her balcony.
      The task was easy even for one in my spent condition. The wall was thick
      with ivy, and, moreover, a window beneath afforded some support, for by
      standing on the heavy coping I could with my fingers touch the sill of the
      balcony above. Thus I hoisted myself, and presently I threw an arm over
      the parapet. Already I was astride of that same Parapet before she became
      aware of my presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song died suddenly on her lips, and her eyes, blue as forget-me-nots,
      were wide now with the fear that the sight of me occasioned. Another
      second and there had been an outcry that would have brought the house
      about our ears, when, stepping to the threshold of the room,
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; I entreated, &ldquo;for the love of God, be silent! I mean you
      no harm. I am a fugitive. I am pursued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was no considered speech. There had been no preparing of words; I had
      uttered them mechanically almost&mdash;perhaps by inspiration, for they
      were surely the best calculated to enlist this lady&rsquo;s sympathy. And so far
      as went the words themselves, they were rigorously true.
    </p>
    <p>
      With eyes wide open still, she confronted me, and I now observed that she
      was not so tall as from below I had imagined. She was, in fact, of a short
      stature rather, but of proportions so exquisite that she conveyed an
      impression of some height. In her hand she held a taper by whose light she
      had been surveying herself in her mirror at the moment of my advent. Her
      unbound hair of brown fell like a mantle about her shoulders, and this
      fact it was drew me to notice that she was in her night-rail, and that
      this room to which I had penetrated was her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly, as though in such a pass my
      identity were a thing that signified.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had almost answered her, as I had answered the troopers at Mirepoix,
      that I was Lesperon. Then, bethinking me that there was no need for such
      equivocation here, I was on the point of giving her my name. But noting my
      hesitation, and misconstruing it, she forestalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, monsieur,&rdquo; said she more composedly. &ldquo;And you need have no
      fear. You are among friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes had travelled over my sodden clothes, the haggard pallor of my
      face, and the blood that stained my doublet from the shoulder downward.
      From all this she had drawn her conclusions that I was a hunted rebel. She
      drew me into the room, and, closing the window, she dragged the heavy
      curtain across it, thereby giving me a proof of confidence that smote me
      hard&mdash;impostor that I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave your pardon, mademoiselle, for having startled you by the rude
      manner of my coming,&rdquo; said I, and never in my life had I felt less at ease
      than then. &ldquo;But I was exhausted and desperate. I am wounded, I have ridden
      hard, and I swam the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter piece of information was vastly unnecessary, seeing that the
      water from my clothes was forming a pool about my feet. &ldquo;I saw you from
      below; mademoiselle, and surely, I thought, so sweet a lady would have
      pity on an unfortunate.&rdquo; She observed that my eyes were upon her, and in
      an act of instinctive maidenliness she bore her hand to her throat to draw
      the draperies together and screen the beauties of her neck from my
      unwarranted glance, as though her daily gown did not reveal as much and
      more of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      That act, however, served to arouse me to a sense of my position. What did
      I there? It was a profanity&mdash;a defiling, I swore; from which you&rsquo;ll
      see, that Bardelys was grown of a sudden very nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;you are exhausted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that I rode hard,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;it is likely they had taken me to
      Toulouse, were I might have lost my head before my friends could have
      found and claimed me. I hope you&rsquo;ll see it is too comely a head to be so
      lightly parted with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that,&rdquo; said she, half seriously, half whimsically, &ldquo;the ugliest head
      would be too comely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed softly, amusedly; then of a sudden, without warning, a faintness
      took me, and I was forced to brace myself against the wall, breathing
      heavily the while. At that she gave a little cry of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I beseech you to be seated. I will summon my father, and we
      will find a bed for you. You must not retain those clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angel of goodness!&rdquo; I muttered gratefully, and being still half dazed, I
      brought some of my Court tricks into that chamber by taking her hand and
      carrying it towards my lips. But ere I had imprinted the intended kiss
      upon her fingers&mdash;and by some miracle they were not withdrawn&mdash;my
      eyes encountered hers again. I paused as one may pause who contemplates a
      sacrilege. For a moment she held my glance with hers; then I fell abashed,
      and released her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innocence peeping out of that child&rsquo;s eyes it was that had in that
      moment daunted me, and made me tremble to think of being found there, and
      of the vile thing it would be to have her name coupled with mine. That
      thought lent me strength. I cast my weariness from me as though it were a
      garment, and, straightening myself, I stepped of a sudden to the window.
      Without a word, I made shift to draw back the curtain when her hand,
      falling on my sodden sleeve, arrested me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do, monsieur?&rdquo; she cried in alarm. &ldquo;You may be seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My mind was now possessed by the thing I should have thought of before. I
      climbed to her balcony, and my one resolve was to get me thence as quickly
      as might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not the right to enter here,&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped
      short; to explain would only be to sully, and so, &ldquo;Good-night! Adieu!&rdquo; I
      ended brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; I commanded almost roughly, as I shook my arm free of her
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you that you are exhausted. If you go forth now, monsieur, you
      will assuredly be taken. You must not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed softly, and with some bitterness, too, for I was angry with
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, child,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Better so, if it is to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that I drew aside the curtains and pushed the leaves of the
      window apart. She remained standing in the room, watching me, her face
      pale, and hex eyes pained and puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      One last glance I gave her as I bestrode the rail of her balcony. Then I
      lowered myself as I had ascended. I was hanging by my hands, seeking with
      my foot for the coping of the window beneath me, when, suddenly, there
      came a buzzing in my ears. I had a fleeting vision of a white figure
      leaning on the balcony above me; then a veil seemed drawn over my eyes;
      there came a sense of falling; a rush as of a tempestuous wind; then&mdash;nothing.

      CHAPTER V. THE VICOMTE DE LAVEDAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      When next I awakened, it was to find myself abed in an elegant apartment,
      spacious and sunlit, that was utterly strange to me. For some seconds I
      was content to lie and take no count of my whereabouts. My eyes travelled
      idly over the handsome furnishings of that choicely appointed chamber, and
      rested at last upon the lean, crooked figure of a man whose back was
      towards me and who was busy with some phials at a table not far distant.
      Then recollection awakened also in me, and I set my wits to work to
      grapple with my surroundings. I looked through the open window, but from
      my position on the bed no more was visible than the blue sky and a faint
      haze of distant hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I taxed my memory, and the events of yesternight recurred to me. I
      remembered the girl, the balcony, and my flight ending in my giddiness and
      my fall. Had they brought me into that same chateau, or&mdash;Or what? No
      other possibility came to suggest itself, and, seeing scant need to tax my
      brains with speculation, since there was one there of whom I might ask the
      question&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hola, my master!&rdquo; I called to him, and as I did so I essayed to move. The
      act wrung a sharp cry of pain from me. My left shoulder was numb and sore,
      but in my right foot that sudden movement had roused a sharper pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      At my cry that little wizened old man swung suddenly round. He had the
      face of a bird of prey, yellow as a louis d&rsquo;or with a great hooked nose,
      and a pair of beady black eyes that observed me solemnly. The mouth alone
      was the redeeming feature in a countenance that had otherwise been evil;
      it was instinct with good-humour. But I had small leisure to observe him
      then, for simultaneously with his turning there had been another movement
      at my bedside, which drew my eyes elsewhere. A gentleman, richly dressed,
      and of an imposing height, approached me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are awake, monsieur?&rdquo; he said in a half interrogative tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the favour to tell me where I am, monsieur?&rdquo; quoth I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know? You are at Lavedan. I am the Vicomte de Lavedan&mdash;at
      your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although it was no more than I might have expected, yet a dull wonder
      filled me, to which presently I gave expression by asking stupidly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Lavedan? But how came I hither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you came is more than I can tell,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll swear the
      King&rsquo;s dragoons were not far behind you. We found you in the courtyard
      last night; in a swoon of exhaustion, wounded in the shoulder, and with a
      sprained foot. It was my daughter who gave the alarm and called us to your
      assistance. You were lying under her widow.&rdquo; Then, seeing the growing
      wonder in my eyes and misconstruing it into alarm: &ldquo;Nay, have no fear,
      monsieur,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You were very well advised in coming to us. You have
      fallen among friends. We are Orleanists too,&mdash;at Lavedan, for all
      that I was not in the fight at Castelnaudary. That was no fault of mine.
      His Grace&rsquo;s messenger reached me overlate, and for all that I set out with
      a company of my men, I put back when I had reached Lautrec upon hearing
      that already a decisive battle had been fought and that our side had
      suffered a crushing defeat.&rdquo; He uttered a weary sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help us, monsieur! Monseigneur de Richelieu is likely to have his way
      with us. But let that be for the present. You are here, and you are safe.
      As yet no suspicion rests on Lavedan. I was, as I have said, too late for
      the fight, and so I came quietly back to save my skin, that I might serve
      the Cause in whatever other way might offer still. In sheltering you I am
      serving Gaston d&rsquo;Orleans, and, that I may continue so to do, I pray that
      suspicion may continue to ignore me. If they were to learn of it at
      Toulouse or of how with money and in other ways I have helped this
      rebellion&mdash;I make no doubt that my head would be the forfeit I should
      be asked to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was aghast at the freedom of treasonable speech with which this very
      debonnaire gentleman ventured to address an utter stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me, Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; resumed my host, &ldquo;how is it with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started in fresh astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how do you know that I am Lesperon?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma foi!&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;do you imagine I had spoken so unreservedly to a
      man of whom I knew nothing? Think better of me, monsieur, I beseech you. I
      found these letters in your pocket last night, and their superscription
      gave me your identity. Your name is well known to me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;My
      friend Monsieur de Marsac has often spoken of you and of your devotion to
      the Cause, and it affords me no little satisfaction to be of some service
      to one whom by repute I have already learned to esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lay back on my pillows, and I groaned. Here was a predicament! Mistaking
      me for that miserable rebel I had succoured at Mirepoix, and whose letters
      I bore upon me that I might restore them to some one whose name he had
      failed to give me at the last moment, the Vicomte de Lavedan had poured
      the damning story of his treason into my ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if I were now to enlighten him? What if I were to tell him that I was
      not Lesperon&mdash;no rebel at all, in fact&mdash;but Marcel de Bardelys,
      the King&rsquo;s favourite? That he would account me a spy I hardly thought; but
      assuredly he would see that my life must be a danger to his own; he must
      fear betrayal from me; and to protect himself he would be justified in
      taking extreme measures. Rebels were not addicted to an excess of niceness
      in their methods, and it was more likely that I should rise no more from
      the luxurious bed on which his hospitality had laid me. But even if I had
      exaggerated matters, and the Vicomte were not quite so bloodthirsty as was
      usual with his order, even if he chose to accept my promise that I would
      forget what he had said, he must nevertheless&mdash;in view of his
      indiscretion&mdash;demand my instant withdrawal from Lavedan. And what,
      then, of my wager with Chatellerault?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in thinking of my wager, I came to think of Roxalanne herself&mdash;that
      dainty, sweet-faced child into whose chamber I had penetrated on the
      previous night. And would you believe it that I&mdash;the satiated,
      cynical, unbelieving Bardelys&mdash;experienced dismay at the very thought
      of leaving Lavedan for no other reason than because it involved seeing no
      more of that provincial damsel?
    </p>
    <p>
      My unwillingness to be driven from her presence determined me to stay. I
      had come to Lavedan as Lesperon, a fugitive rebel. In that character I had
      all but announced myself last night to Mademoiselle. In that character I
      had been welcomed by her father. In that character, then, I must remain,
      that I might be near her, that I might woo and win her, and thus&mdash;though
      this, I swear, had now become a minor consideration with me&mdash;make
      good my boast and win the wager that must otherwise involve my ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I lay back with closed eyes and gave myself over to pondering the
      situation, I took a pleasure oddly sweet in the prospect of urging my suit
      under such circumstances. Chatellerault had given me a free hand. I was to
      go about the wooing of Mademoiselle de Lavedan as I chose. But he had cast
      it at me in defiance that not with all my magnificence, not with all my
      retinue and all my state to dazzle her, should I succeed in melting the
      coldest heart in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, behold! I had cast from me all these outward embellishments; I
      came without pomp, denuded of every emblem of wealth, of every sign of
      power; as a poor fugitive gentleman, I came, hunted, proscribed, and
      penniless&mdash;for Lesperon&rsquo;s estate would assuredly suffer
      sequestration. To win her thus would, by my faith, be an exploit I might
      take pride in, a worthy achievement to encompass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I left things as they were, and since I offered no denial to the
      identity that was thrust upon me, as Lesperon I continued to be known to
      the Vicomte and to his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he called the old man to my bedside and I heard them talking of
      my condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think, then, Anatole,&rdquo; he said in the end, &ldquo;that in three or four
      days Monsieur de Lesperon may be able to rise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am assured of it,&rdquo; replied the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, turning to me, &ldquo;Be therefore of good courage, monsieur,&rdquo; said
      Lavedan, &ldquo;for your hurt is none so grievous after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was muttering my thanks and my assurances that I was in excellent
      spirits, when we were suddenly disturbed by a rumbling noise as of distant
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mort Dieu!&rdquo; swore the Vicomte, a look of alarm coming into his face. With
      a bent head, he stood in a listening attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horsemen&mdash;on the drawbridge,&rdquo; he answered shortly. &ldquo;A troop, by the
      sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, in confirmation of these words, followed a stamping and rattle
      of hoofs on the flags of the courtyard below. The old servant stood
      wringing his hands in helpless terror, and wailing, &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Vicomte crossed rapidly to the window and looked out. Then he
      laughed with intense relief; and in a wondering voice &ldquo;They are not
      troopers,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;They have more the air of a company of servants
      in private livery; and there is a carriage&mdash;pardieu, two carriages!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once the memory of Rodenard and my followers occurred to me, and I
      thanked Heaven that I was abed where he might not see me, and that thus he
      would probably be sent forth empty-handed with the news that his master
      was neither arrived nor expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that surmise I went too fast. Ganymede was of a tenacious mettle,
      and of this he now afforded proof. Upon learning that naught was known of
      the Marquis de Bardelys at Lavedan, my faithful henchman announced his
      intention to remain there and await me, since that was, he assured the
      Vicomte, my destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My first impulse,&rdquo; said Lavedan, when later he came to tell me of it,
      &ldquo;was incontinently to order his departure. But upon considering the matter
      and remembering how high in power and in the King&rsquo;s favour stands that
      monstrous libertine Bardelys, I deemed it wiser to afford shelter to this
      outrageous retinue. His steward&mdash;a flabby, insolent creature&mdash;says
      that Bardelys left them last night near Mirepoix, to ride hither, bidding
      them follow to-day. Curious that we should have no news of him! That he
      should have fallen into the Garonne and drowned himself were too great a
      good fortune to be hoped for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bitterness with which he spoke of me afforded me ample cause for
      congratulation that I had resolved to accept the role of Lesperon. Yet,
      remembering that my father and he had been good friends, his manner left
      me nonplussed. What cause could he have for this animosity to the son?
      Could it be merely my position at Court that made me seem in his rebel
      eyes a natural enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are acquainted with this Bardelys?&rdquo; I inquired, by way of drawing
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew his father,&rdquo; he answered gruffly. &ldquo;An honest, upright gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the son,&rdquo; I inquired timidly, &ldquo;has he none of these virtues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not what virtues he may have; his vices are known to all the
      world. He is a libertine, a gambler, a rake, a spendthrift. They say he is
      one of the King&rsquo;s favourites, and that his monstrous extravagances have
      earned for him the title of &lsquo;Magnificent&rsquo;.&rdquo; He uttered a short laugh. &ldquo;A
      fit servant for such a master as Louis the Just!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Vicomte,&rdquo; said I, warming in my own defence, &ldquo;I swear you do
      him injustice. He is extravagant, but then he is rich; he is a libertine,
      but then he is young, and he has been reared among libertines; he is a
      gamester, but punctiliously honourable at play. Believe me, monsieur, I
      have some acquaintance with Marcel de Bardelys, and his vices are hardly
      so black as is generally believed; whilst in his favour I think the same
      may be said that you have just said of his father&mdash;he is an honest,
      upright gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that disgraceful affair with the Duchesse de Bourgogne?&rdquo; inquired
      Lavedan, with the air of a man setting an unanswerable question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;will the world never forget that indiscretion? An
      indiscretion of youth, no doubt much exaggerated outside Court circles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte eyed me in some astonishment for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;you appear to hold this
      Bardelys in high esteem. He has a staunch supporter in you and a stout
      advocate. Yet me you cannot convince.&rdquo; And he shook his head solemnly.
      &ldquo;Even if I did not hold him to be such a man as I have pronounced him, but
      were to account him a paragon of all the virtues, his coming hither
      remains an act that I must resent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, Monsieur le Vicomte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know the errand that brings him to Lavedan. He comes to woo my
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had he flung a bomb into my bed he could not more effectively have
      startled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It astonishes you, eh?&rdquo; he laughed bitterly. &ldquo;But I can assure you that
      it is so. A month ago I was visited by the Comte de Chatellerault&mdash;another
      of His Majesty&rsquo;s fine favourites. He came unbidden; offered no reason for
      his coming, save that he was making a tour of the province for his
      amusement. His acquaintance with me was of the slightest, and I had no
      desire that it should increase; yet here he installed himself with a
      couple of servants, and bade fair to take a long stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was surprised, but on the morrow I had an explanation. A courier,
      arriving from an old friend of mine at Court, bore me a letter with the
      information that Monsieur de Chatellerault was come to Lavedan at the
      King&rsquo;s instigation to sue for my daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage. The reasons
      were not far to seek. The King, who loves him, would enrich him; the
      easiest way is by a wealthy alliance, and Roxalanne is accounted an
      heiress. In addition to that, my own power in the province is known,
      whilst my defection from the Cardinalist party is feared. What better link
      wherewith to attach me again to the fortunes of the Crown&mdash;for Crown
      and Mitre have grown to be synonymous in this topsy-turvy France&mdash;than
      to wed my daughter to one of the King&rsquo;s favourites?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for that timely warning, God knows what mischief had been wrought. As
      it was, Monsieur de Chatellerault had but seen my daughter upon two
      occasions. On the very day that I received the tidings I speak of, I sent
      her to Auch to the care of some relatives of her mother&rsquo;s. Chatellerault
      remained a week. Then, growing restive, he asked when my daughter would
      return. &lsquo;When you depart, monsieur,&rsquo; I answered him, and, being pressed
      for reasons, I dealt so frankly with him that within twenty-four hours he
      was on his way back to Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte paused and took a turn in the apartment, whilst I pondered his
      words, which were bringing me a curious revelation. Presently he resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Chatellerault having failed in his purpose, the King chooses a
      more dangerous person for the gratifying of his desires. He sends the
      Marquis, Marcel de Bardelys to Lavedan on the same business. No doubt he
      attributes Chatellerault&rsquo;s failure to clumsiness, and he has decided this
      time to choose a man famed for courtly address and gifted with such arts
      of dalliance that he cannot fail but enmesh my daughter in them. It is a
      great compliment that he pays us in sending hither the handsomest and most
      accomplished gentleman of all his Court&mdash;so fame has it&mdash;yet it
      is a compliment of whose flattery I am not sensible. Bardelys goes hence
      as empty-handed as went Chatellerault. Let him but show his face, and my
      daughter journeys to Auch again. Am I not well advised, Monsieur de
      Lesperon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; I answered slowly, after the manner of one who deliberates,
      &ldquo;if you are persuaded that your conclusions touching Bardelys are
      correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more than persuaded. What other business could bring him to
      Lavedan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a question that I did not attempt to answer. Haply he did not
      expect me to answer it. He left me free to ponder another issue of this
      same business of which my mind was become very full. Chatellerault had not
      dealt fairly with me. Often, since I had left Paris, had I marvelled that
      he came to be so rash as to risk his fortune upon a matter that turned
      upon a woman&rsquo;s whim. That I possessed undeniable advantages of person, of
      birth, and of wealth, Chatellerault could not have disregarded. Yet these,
      and the possibility that they might suffice to engage this lady&rsquo;s
      affections, he appeared to have set at naught when he plunged into that
      rash wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have realized that because he had failed was no reason to presume
      that I must also fail. There was no consequence in such an argument, and
      often, as I have said, had I marvelled during the past days at the
      readiness with which Chatellerault had flung down the gage. Now I held the
      explanation of it. He counted upon the Vicomte de Lavedan to reason
      precisely as he was reasoning, and he was confident that no opportunities
      would be afforded me of so much as seeing this beautiful and cold
      Roxalanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wily trap he had set me, worthy only of a trickster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate, however, had taken a hand in the game, and the cards were redealt
      since I had left Paris. The terms of the wager permitted me to choose any
      line of action that I considered desirable; but Destiny, it seemed, had
      chosen for me, and set me in a line that should at least suffice to
      overcome the parental resistance&mdash;that breastwork upon which
      Chatellerault had so confidently depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the rebel Rene de Lesperon I was sheltered at Lavedan and made welcome
      by my fellow-rebel the Vicomte, who already seemed much taken with me, and
      who had esteemed me before seeing me from the much that Monsieur de Marsac&mdash;whoever
      he might be&mdash;had told him of me. As Rene de Lesperon I must remain,
      and turn to best account my sojourn, praying God meanwhile that this same
      Monsieur de Marsac might be pleased to refrain from visiting Lavedan
      whilst I was there.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. IN CONVALESCENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the week that followed my coming to Lavedan I find some difficulty in
      writing. It was for me a time very crowded with events&mdash;events that
      appeared to be moulding my character anew and making of me a person
      different, indeed, from that Marcel de Bardelys whom in Paris they called
      the Magnificent. Yet these events, although significant in their total,
      were of so vague and slight a nature in their detail, that when I come to
      write of them I find really little that I may set down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodenard and his companions remained for two days at the chateau, and to
      me his sojourn there was a source of perpetual anxiety, for I knew not how
      far the fool might see fit to prolong it. It was well for me that this
      anxiety of mine was shared by Monsieur de Lavedan, who disliked at such a
      time the presence of men attached to one who was so notoriously of the
      King&rsquo;s party. He came at last to consult me as to what measures might be
      taken to remove them, and I&mdash;nothing loath to conspire with him to so
      desirable end&mdash;bade him suggest to Rodenard that perhaps evil had
      befallen Monsieur de Bardelys, and that, instead of wasting his time at
      Lavedan, he were better advised to be searching the province for his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      This counsel the Vicomte adopted, and with such excellent results that
      that very day&mdash;within the hour, in fact&mdash;Ganymede, aroused to a
      sense of his proper duty, set out in quest of me, not a little disturbed
      in mind&mdash;for with all his shortcomings the rascal loved me very
      faithfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on the third day of my sojourn at Lavedan. On the morrow I rose,
      my foot being sufficiently recovered to permit it. I felt a little weak
      from loss of blood, but Anatole&mdash;who, for all his evil countenance,
      was a kindly and gentle&mdash;servant was confident that a few days&mdash;a
      week at most&mdash;would see me completely restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of leaving Lavedan I said nothing. But the Vicomte, who was one of the
      most generous and noble hearted men that it has ever been my good fortune
      to meet, forestalled any mention of my departure by urging that I should
      remain at the chateau until my recovery were completed, and, for that
      matter, as long thereafter as should suit my inclinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Lavedan you will be safe, my friend,&rdquo; he assured me; &ldquo;for, as I have
      told you, we are under no suspicion. Let me urge you to remain until the
      King shall have desisted from further persecuting us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when I protested and spoke of trespassing, he waived the point with a
      brusqueness that amounted almost to anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe, monsieur, that I am pleased and honoured at serving one who has
      so stoutly served the Cause and sacrificed so much to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that, being not altogether dead to shame, I winced, and told myself
      that my behaviour was unworthy, and that I was practising a detestable
      deception. Yet some indulgence I may justly claim in consideration of how
      far I was victim of circumstance. Did I tell him that I was Bardelys, I
      was convinced that I should never leave the chateau alive. Very
      noble-hearted was the Vicomte, and no man have I known more averse to
      bloodthirstiness, but he had told me much during the days that I had lain
      abed, and many lives would be jeopardized did I proclaim what I had
      learned from him. Hence I argued that any disclosure of my identity must
      perforce drive him to extreme measures for the sake of the friends he had
      unwittingly betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day after Rodenard&rsquo;s departure I dined with the family, and met
      again Mademoiselle de Lavedan, whom I had not seen since the balcony
      adventure of some nights ago. The Vicomtesse was also present, a lady of
      very austere and noble appearance&mdash;lean as a pike and with a most
      formidable nose&mdash;but, as I was soon to discover, with a mind
      inclining overmuch to scandal and the high-seasoned talk of the Courts in
      which her girlhood had been spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her lips I heard that day the old, scandalous story of Monseigneur de
      Richelieu&rsquo;s early passion for Anne of Austria. With much unction did she
      tell us how the Queen had lured His Eminence to dress himself in the
      motley of a jester that she might make a mock of him in the eyes of the
      courtiers she had concealed behind the arras of her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote she gave us with much wealth of discreditable detail and
      scant regard for either her daughter&rsquo;s presence or for the blushes that
      suffused the poor child&rsquo;s cheeks. In every way she was a pattern of the
      class of women amongst whom my youth had been spent, a class which had
      done so much towards shattering my faith and lowering my estimate of her
      sex. Lavedan had married her and brought her into Languedoc, and here she
      spent her years lamenting the scenes of her youth, and prone, it would
      seem, to make them matter for conversation whenever a newcomer chanced to
      present himself at the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking from her to her daughter, I thanked Heaven that Roxalanne was no
      reproduction of the mother. She had inherited as little of her character
      as of her appearance. Both in feature and in soul Mademoiselle de Lavedan
      was a copy of that noble, gallant gentleman, her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other was present at that meal, of whom I shall have more to say
      hereafter. This was a young man of good presence, save, perhaps, a too
      obtrusive foppishness, whom Monsieur de Lavedan presented to me as a
      distant kinsman of theirs, one Chevalier de Saint-Eustache. He was very
      tall&mdash;of fully my own height&mdash;and of an excellent shape,
      although extremely young. But his head if anything was too small for his
      body, and his good-natured mouth was of a weakness that was confirmed by
      the significance of his chin, whilst his eyes were too closely set to
      augur frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a pleasant fellow, seemingly of that negative pleasantness that
      lies in inoffensiveness, but otherwise dull and of an untutored mind&mdash;rustic,
      as might be expected in one the greater part of whose life had been spent
      in his native province, and of a rusticity rendered all the more flagrant
      by the very efforts he exerted to dissemble it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after madame had related that unsavoury anecdote touching the
      Cardinal that he turned to ask me whether I was well acquainted with the
      Court. I was near to committing the egregious blunder of laughing in his
      face, but, recollecting myself betimes, I answered vaguely that I had some
      knowledge of it, whereupon he all but caused me to bound from my chair by
      asking me had I ever met the Magnificent Bardelys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am acquainted with him,&rdquo; I answered warily. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was reminded of him by the fact that his servants have been here for
      two days. You were expecting the Marquis himself, were you not, Monsieur
      le Vicomte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavedan raised his head suddenly, after the manner of a man who has
      received an affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not, Chevalier,&rdquo; he answered, with emphasis. &ldquo;His intendant, an
      insolent knave of the name of Rodenard, informed me that this Bardelys
      projected visiting me. He has not come, and I devoutly hope that he may
      not come. Trouble enough had I to rid myself of his servants, and but for
      Monsieur de Lesperon&rsquo;s well-conceived suggestion they might still be
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never met him, monsieur?&rdquo; inquired the Chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied our host in such a way that any but a fool must have
      understood that he desired nothing less than such a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A delightful fellow,&rdquo; murmured Saint-Eustache&mdash;&ldquo;a brilliant,
      dazzling personality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you are acquainted with him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acquainted?&rdquo; echoed that boastful liar. &ldquo;We were as brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you interest me! And why have you never told us?&rdquo; quoth madame, her
      eyes turned enviously upon the young man&mdash;as enviously as were
      Lavedan&rsquo;s turned in disgust. &ldquo;It is a thousand pities that Monsieur de
      Bardelys has altered his plans and is no longer coming to us. To meet such
      a man is to breathe again the air of the grand monde. You remember,
      Monsieur de Lesperon, that affair with the Duchess de Bourgogne?&rdquo; And she
      smiled wickedly in my direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some recollection of it,&rdquo; I answered coldly. &ldquo;But I think that
      rumour exaggerates. When tongues wag, a little rivulet is often described
      as a mountain torrent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not say so did you but know what I know,&rdquo; she informed me
      roguishly. &ldquo;Often, I confess, rumour may swell the importance of such an
      affaire, but in this case I do not think that rumour does it justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made a deprecatory gesture, and I would have had the subject changed,
      but ere I could make an effort to that end, the fool Saint-Eustache was
      babbling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember the duel that was fought in consequence, Monsieur de
      Lesperon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I assented wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in which a poor young fellow lost his life,&rdquo; growled the Vicomte. &ldquo;It
      was practically a murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, monsieur,&rdquo; I cried, with a sudden heat that set them staring at me;
      &ldquo;there you do him wrong. Monsieur de Bardelys was opposed to the best
      blade in France. The man&rsquo;s reputation as a swordsman was of such a quality
      that for a twelvemonth he had been living upon it, doing all manner of
      unseemly things immune from punishment by the fear in which he was
      universally held. His behaviour in the unfortunate affair we are
      discussing was of a particularly shameful character. Oh, I know the
      details, messieurs, I can sure you. He thought to impose his reputation
      upon Bardelys as he had imposed it upon a hundred others, but Bardelys was
      over-tough for his teeth. He sent that notorious young gentleman a
      challenge, and on the following morning he left him dead in the
      horsemarket behind the Hotel Vendome. But far from a murder, monsieur, it
      was an act of justice, and the most richly earned punishment with which
      ever man was visited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if so,&rdquo; cried the Vicomte in some surprise, &ldquo;why all this heat to
      defend a brawler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brawler?&rdquo; I repeated after him. &ldquo;Oh, no. That is a charge his worst
      enemies cannot make against Bardelys. He is no brawler. The duel in
      question was his first affair of the kind, and it has been his last, for
      unto him has clung the reputation that had belonged until then to La
      Vertoile, and there is none in France bold enough to send a challenge to
      him.&rdquo; And, seeing what surprise I was provoking, I thought it well to
      involve another with me in his defence. So, turning to the Chevalier, &ldquo;I
      am sure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that Monsieur de Saint-Eustache will confirm my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, his vanity being all aroused, the Chevalier set himself to
      paraphrase all that I had said with a heat that cast mine into a miserable
      insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; laughed the Vicomte at length, &ldquo;he lacks not for champions.
      For my own part, I am content to pray Heaven that he come not to Lavedan,
      as he intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais voyons, Gaston,&rdquo; the Vicomtesse protested, &ldquo;why harbour prejudice?
      Wait at least until you have seen him, that you may judge him for
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already have I judged him; I pray that I may never see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me he is a very handsome man,&rdquo; said she, appealing to me for
      confirmation. Lavedan shot her a sudden glance of alarm, at which I could
      have laughed. Hitherto his sole concern had been his daughter, but it
      suddenly occurred to him that perhaps not even her years might set the
      Vicomtesse in safety from imprudences with this devourer of hearts, should
      he still chance to come that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;he is accounted not ill-favored.&rdquo; And with a
      deprecatory smile I added, &ldquo;I am said somewhat to resemble him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo; she exclaimed, raising her eyebrows, and looking at me more
      closely than hitherto. And then it seemed to me that into her face crept a
      shade of disappointment. If this Bardelys were not more beautiful than I,
      then he was not nearly so beautiful a man as she had imagined. She turned
      to Saint-Eustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is indeed so, Chevalier?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;Do you note the resemblance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vanitas, vanitate,&rdquo; murmured the youth, who had some scraps of Latin and
      a taste for airing them. &ldquo;I can see no likeness&mdash;no trace of one.
      Monsieur de Lesperon is well enough, I should say. But Bardelys!&rdquo; He cast
      his eyes to the ceiling. &ldquo;There is but one Bardelys in France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enfin,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;you are no doubt well qualified to judge, Chevalier.
      I had flattered myself that some likeness did exist, but probably you have
      seen the Marquis more frequently than have I, and probably you know him
      better. Nevertheless, should he come his way, I will ask you to look at us
      side by side and be the judge of the resemblance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I happen to be here,&rdquo; he said, with a sudden constraint not
      difficult to understand, &ldquo;I shall be happy to act as arbiter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you happen to be here?&rdquo; I echoed questioningly. &ldquo;But surely,
      should you hear that Monsieur de Bardelys is about to arrive, you will
      postpone any departure you may be on the point of making, so that you may
      renew this great friendship that you tell us you do the Marquis the honour
      of entertaining for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier eyed me with the air of a man looking down from a great
      height upon another. The Vicomte smiled quietly to himself as he combed
      his fair beard with his forefinger in a meditative fashion, whilst even
      Roxalanne&mdash;who had sat silently listening to a conversation that she
      was at times mercifully spared from following too minutely&mdash;flashed
      me a humorous glance. To the Vicomtesse alone who in common with women of
      her type was of a singular obtuseness&mdash;was the situation without
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Eustache, to defend himself against my delicate imputation, and to
      show how well acquainted he was with Bardelys, plunged at once into a
      thousand details of that gentleman&rsquo;s magnificence. He described his
      suppers, his retinue, his equipages, his houses, his chateaux, his favour
      with the King, his successes with the fair sex, and I know not what
      besides&mdash;in all of which I confess that even to me there was a
      certain degree of novelty. Roxalanne listened with an air of amusement
      that showed how well she read him. Later, when I found myself alone with
      her by the river, whither we had gone after the repast and the Chevalier&rsquo;s
      reminiscences were at an end, she reverted to that conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not my cousin a great fanfarron, monsieur,&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you know your cousin better than I,&rdquo; I answered cautiously. &ldquo;Why
      question me upon his character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hardly questioning; I was commenting. He spent a fortnight in Paris
      once, and he accounts himself, or would have us account him, intimate with
      every courtier at the Luxembourg. Oh, he is very amusing, this good
      cousin, but tiresome too.&rdquo; She laughed, and there was the faintest note of
      scorn in her amusement. &ldquo;Now, touching this Marquis de Bardelys, it is
      very plain that the Chevalier boasted when he said that they were as
      brothers&mdash;he and the Marquis&mdash;is it not? He grew ill at ease
      when you reminded him of the possibility of the Marquis&rsquo;s visit to
      Lavedan.&rdquo; And she laughed quaintly to herself. &ldquo;Do you think that he so
      much as knows Bardelys?&rdquo; she asked me suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much as by sight,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He is full of information
      concerning that unworthy gentleman, but it is only information that the
      meanest scullion in Paris might afford you, and just as inaccurate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak of him as unworthy? Are you of the same opinion as my
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and with better cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him? Pardieu, he is my worst enemy. A worn-out libertine; a
      sneering, cynical misogynist; a nauseated reveller; a hateful egotist.
      There is no more unworthy person, I&rsquo;ll swear, in all France. Peste! The
      very memory of the fellow makes me sick. Let us talk of other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But although I urged it with the best will and the best intentions in the
      world, I was not to have my way. The air became suddenly heavy with the
      scent of musk, and the Chevalier de Saint-Eustache stood before us, and
      forced the conversation once more upon the odious topic of Monsieur de
      Bardelys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fool came with a plan of campaign carefully considered, bent now
      upon overthrowing me with the knowledge he would exhibit, and whereby he
      looked to encompass my humiliation before his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of Bardelys, Monsieur de Lesperon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Chevalier, we were no longer speaking of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled darkly. &ldquo;Let us speak of him, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are there not a thousand more interesting things that we might speak
      of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he took for a fresh sign of fear, and so he pressed what he accounted
      his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet have patience; there is a point on which perhaps you can give me some
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you acquainted with the Duchesse de Bourgogne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; I answered casually, and as casually I added, &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellently well,&rdquo; he replied unhesitatingly. &ldquo;I was in Paris at the time
      of the scandal with Bardelys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it then that you met her?&rdquo; I inquired in an idle sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was in the confidence of Bardelys, and one night after we had
      supped at his hotel&mdash;one of those suppers graced by every wit in
      Paris&mdash;he asked me if I were minded to accompany him to the Louvre.
      We went. A masque was in progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, after the manner of one who suddenly takes in the entire
      situation; &ldquo;and it was at this masque that you met the Duchesse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have guessed it. Ah, monsieur, if I were to tell you of the things
      that I witnessed that night, they would amaze you,&rdquo; said he, with a great
      air and a casual glance at Mademoiselle to see into what depth of wonder
      these glimpses into his wicked past were plunging her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it not,&rdquo; said I, thinking that if his imagination were as fertile
      in that connection as it had been in mine he was likely, indeed, to have
      some amazing things to tell. &ldquo;But do I understand you to say that that was
      the time of the scandal you have touched upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scandal burst three days after that masque. It came as a surprise to
      most people. As for me&mdash;from what Bardelys had told me&mdash;I
      expected nothing less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Chevalier, but how old do you happen to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A curious question that,&rdquo; said he, knitting his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But will you not answer it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty-one,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are twenty, mon cousin,&rdquo; Roxalanne corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her a second with an injured air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, true&mdash;twenty! That is so,&rdquo; he acquiesced; and again, &ldquo;what of
      it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it, monsieur?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;Will you forgive me if I express
      amazement at your precocity, and congratulate you upon it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His brows went if possible closer together and his face grew very red. He
      knew that somewhere a pitfall awaited him, yet hardly where.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, Chevalier. Ten years have flown since this scandal you refer
      to. So that at the time of your supping with Bardelys and the wits of
      Paris, at the time of his making a confidant of you and carrying you off
      to a masque at the Louvre, at the time of his presenting you to the
      Duchesse de Bourgogne, you were just ten years of age. I never had cause
      to think over-well of Bardelys, but had you not told me yourself, I should
      have hesitated to believe him so vile a despoiler of innocence, such a
      perverter of youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crimsoned to the very roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roxalanne broke into a laugh. &ldquo;My cousin, my cousin,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;they
      that would become masters should begin early, is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; said he, in a very formal voice, &ldquo;do you wish me
      to apprehend that you have put me through this catechism for the purpose
      of casting a doubt upon what I have said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have I done that? Have I cast a doubt?&rdquo; I asked, with the utmost
      meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I apprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you apprehend amiss. Your words, I assure you, admit of no doubt
      whatever. And now, monsieur, if you will have mercy upon me, we will talk
      of other things. I am so weary of this unfortunate Bardelys and his
      affairs. He may be the fashion of Paris and at Court, but down here his
      very name befouls the air. Mademoiselle,&rdquo; I said, turning to Roxalanne,
      &ldquo;you promised me a lesson in the lore of flowers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said she, and, being an exceedingly wise child, she plunged
      straightway into the history of the shrubs about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did we avert a storm that for a moment was very imminent. Yet some
      mischief was done, and some good, too, perhaps. For if I made an enemy of
      the Chevalier de Saint-Eustache by humbling him in the eyes of the one
      woman before whom he sought to shine, I established a bond &lsquo;twixt
      Roxalanne and myself by that same humiliation of a foolish coxcomb, whose
      boastfulness had long wearied her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE HOSTILITY OF SAINT-EUSTACHE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the days that followed I saw much of the Chevalier de Saint-Eustache.
      He was a very constant visitor at Lavedan, and the reason of it was not
      far to seek. For my own part, I disliked him&mdash;I had done so from the
      moment when first I had set eyes on him&mdash;and since hatred, like
      affection, is often a matter of reciprocity, the Chevalier was not slow to
      return my dislike. Our manner gradually, by almost imperceptible stages,
      grew more distant, until by the end of a week it had become so hostile
      that Lavedan found occasion to comment upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of Saint-Eustache,&rdquo; he warned me. &ldquo;You are becoming very
      manifestly distasteful to each other, and I would urge you to have a care.
      I don&rsquo;t trust him. His attachment to our Cause is of a lukewarm character,
      and he gives me uneasiness, for he may do much harm if he is so inclined.
      It is on this account that I tolerate his presence at Lavedan. Frankly, I
      fear him, and I would counsel you to do no less. The man is a liar, even
      if but a boastful liar and liars are never long out of mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wisdom of the words was unquestionable, but the advice in them was not
      easily followed, particularly by one whose position was so peculiar as my
      own. In a way I had little cause to fear the harm the Chevalier might do
      me, but I was impelled to consider the harm that at the same time he might
      do the Vicomte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite our growing enmity, the Chevalier and I were very frequently
      thrown together. The reason for this was, of course, that wherever
      Roxalanne was to be found there, generally, were we both to be found also.
      Yet had I advantages that must have gone to swell a rancour based as much
      upon jealousy as any other sentiment, for whilst he was but a daily
      visitor at Lavedan, I was established there indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the use that I made of that time I find it difficult to speak. From the
      first moment that I had beheld Roxalanne I had realized the truth of
      Chatellerault&rsquo;s assertion that I had never known a woman. He was right.
      Those that I had met and by whom I had judged the sex had, by contrast
      with this child, little claim to the title. Virtue I had accounted a
      shadow without substance; innocence, a synonym for ignorance; love, a
      fable, a fairy tale for the delectation of overgrown children.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the company of Roxalanne de Lavedan all those old, cynical beliefs,
      built up upon a youth of undesirable experiences, were shattered and the
      error of them exposed. Swiftly was I becoming a convert to the faith which
      so long I had sneered at, and as lovesick as any unfledged youth in his
      first amour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damn! It was something for a man who had lived as I had lived to have his
      pulses quicken and his colour change at a maid&rsquo;s approach; to find himself
      colouring under her smile and paling under her disdain; to have his mind
      running on rhymes, and his soul so enslaved that, if she is not to be won,
      chagrin will dislodge it from his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a fine mood for a man who had entered upon his business by
      pledging himself to win and wed this girl in cold and supreme indifference
      to her personality. And that pledge, how I cursed it during those days at
      Lavedan! How I cursed Chatellerault, cunning, subtle trickster that he
      was! How I cursed myself for my lack of chivalry and honour in having been
      lured so easily into so damnable a business! For when the memory of that
      wager rose before me it brought despair in its train. Had I found
      Roxalanne the sort of woman that I had looked to find&mdash;the only sort
      that I had ever known&mdash;then matters had been easy. I had set myself
      in cold blood, and by such wiles as I knew, to win such affection as might
      be hers to bestow; and I would have married her in much the same spirit as
      a man performs any other of the necessary acts of his lifetime and
      station. I would have told her that I was Bardelys, and to the woman that
      I had expected to find there had been no difficulty in making the
      confession. But to Roxalanne! Had there been no wager, I might have
      confessed my identity. As it was, I found it impossible to avow the one
      without the other. For the sweet innocence that invested her gentle,
      trusting soul must have given pause to any but the most abandoned of men
      before committing a vileness in connection with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were much together during that week, and just as day by day, hour by
      hour, my passion grew and grew until it absorbed me utterly, so, too, did
      it seem to me that it awakened in her a responsive note. There was an odd
      light at times in her soft eyes; I came upon her more than once with
      snatches of love-songs on her lips, and when she smiled upon me there was
      a sweet tenderness in her smile, which, had things been different, would
      have gladdened my soul beyond all else; but which, things being as they
      were, was rather wont to heighten my despair. I was no coxcomb; I had had
      experiences, and I knew these signs. But something, too, I guessed of the
      heart of such a one as Roxalanne. To the full I realized the pain and
      shame I should inflict upon her when my confession came; I realized, too,
      how the love of this dear child, so honourable and high of mind, must turn
      to contempt and scorn when I plucked away my mask, and let her see how
      poor a countenance I wore beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I drifted with the tide of things. It was my habit so to drift,
      and the habit of a lifetime is not to be set at naught in a day by a
      resolve, however firm. A score of times was I reminded that an evil is but
      increased by being ignored. A score of times confession trembled on my
      lips, and I burned to tell her everything from its inception&mdash;the
      environment that had erstwhile warped me, the honesty by which I was now
      inspired&mdash;and so cast myself upon the mercy of her belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might accept my story, and, attaching credit to it, forgive me the
      deception I had practised, and recognize the great truth that must ring
      out in the avowal of my love. But, on the other hand, she might not accept
      it; she might deem my confession a shrewd part of my scheme, and the dread
      of that kept me silent day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully did I see how with every hour that sped confession became more and
      more difficult. The sooner the thing were done, the greater the likelihood
      of my being believed; the later I left it, the more probable was it that I
      should be discredited. Alas! Bardelys, it seemed, had added cowardice to
      his other short-comings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the coldness of Roxalanne, that was a pretty fable of
      Chatellerault&rsquo;s; or else no more than an assumption, an invention of the
      imaginative La Fosse. Far, indeed, from it, I found no arrogance or
      coldness in her. All unversed in the artifices of her sex, all
      unacquainted with the wiles of coquetry, she was the very incarnation of
      naturalness and maidenly simplicity. To the tales that&mdash;with many
      expurgations&mdash;I told her of Court life, to the pictures that I drew
      of Paris, the Luxembourg, the Louvre, the Palais Cardinal, and the
      courtiers that thronged those historic palaces, she listened avidly and
      enthralled; and much as Othello won the heart of Desdemona by a recital of
      the perils he had endured, so it seemed to me was I winning the heart of
      Roxalanne by telling her of the things that I had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice she expressed wonder at the depth and intimacy of the
      knowledge of such matters exhibited by a simple Gascon gentleman,
      whereupon I would urge, in explanation, the appointment in the Guards that
      Lesperon had held some few years ago, a position that will reveal much to
      an observant man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte noted our growing intimacy, yet set no restraint upon it. Down
      in his heart I believe that noble gentleman would have been well pleased
      had matters gone to extremes between us, for however impoverished he might
      deem me; Lesperon&rsquo;s estates in Gascony being, as I have said, likely to
      suffer sequestration in view of his treason&mdash;he remembered the causes
      of this and the deep devotion of the man I impersonated to the affairs of
      Gaston d&rsquo;Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, he feared the very obvious courtship of the Chevalier de
      Saint-Eustache, and he would have welcomed a turn of events that would
      effectually have frustrated it. That he did not himself interfere so far
      as the Chevalier&rsquo;s wooing was concerned, I could but set down to the
      mistrust of Saint-Eustache&mdash;amounting almost to fear&mdash;of which
      he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Vicomtesse, the same causes that had won me some of the
      daughter&rsquo;s regard gained me also no little of the mother&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been attached to the Chevalier until my coming. But what did the
      Chevalier know of the great world compared with what I could tell? Her
      love of scandal drew her to me with inquiries upon this person and that
      person, many of them but names to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My knowledge and wealth of detail&mdash;for all that I curbed it lest I
      should seem to know too much&mdash;delighted her prurient soul. Had she
      been more motherly, this same knowledge that I exhibited should have made
      her ponder what manner of life I had led, and should have inspired her to
      account me no fit companion for her daughter. But a selfish woman, little
      inclined to be plagued by the concerns of another&mdash;even when that
      other was her daughter&mdash;she left things to the destructive course
      that they were shaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so everything&mdash;if we except perhaps the Chevalier de
      Saint-Eustache&mdash;conspired to the advancement of my suit, in a manner
      that must have made Chatellerault grind his teeth in rage if he could have
      witnessed it, but which made me grind mine in despair when I pondered the
      situation in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;I had been ten days at the chateau&mdash;we went a
      half-league or so up the Garonne in a boat, she and I. As we were
      returning, drifting with the stream, the oars idle in my hand, I spoke of
      leaving Lavedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up quickly; her expression was almost of alarm, and her eyes
      dilated as they met mine&mdash;for, as I have said, she was all unversed
      in the ways of her sex, and by nature too guileless to attempt to disguise
      her feelings or dissemble them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why must you go so soon?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You are safe at Lavedan, and
      abroad you may be in danger. It was but two days ago that they took a poor
      young gentleman of these parts at Pau; so that you see the persecution is
      not yet ended. Are you&rdquo;&mdash;and her voice trembled ever so slightly&mdash;&ldquo;are
      you weary of us, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head at that, and smiled wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weary?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;Surely, mademoiselle, you do not think it? Surely your
      heart must tell you something very different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her eyes before the passion of my gaze. And when presently she
      answered me, there was no guile in her words; there were the dictates of
      the intuitions of her sex, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is possible, monsieur. You are accustomed to the great world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great world of Lesperon, in Gascony?&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; the great world you have inhabited at Paris and elsewhere. I can
      understand that at Lavedan you should find little of interest, and&mdash;and
      that your inactivity should render you impatient to be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were so little to interest me then it might be as you say. But,
      oh, mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo; I ceased abruptly. Fool! I had almost fallen a
      prey to the seductions that the time afforded me. The balmy, languorous
      eventide, the broad, smooth river down which we glided, the foliage, the
      shadows on the water, her presence, and our isolation amid such
      surroundings, had almost blotted out the matter of the wager and of my
      duplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little nervous laugh, and&mdash;maybe to ease the tension
      that my sudden silence had begotten&mdash;&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how your
      imagination deserts you when you seek to draw upon it for proof of what
      you protest. You were about to tell me of&mdash;of the interests that hold
      you at Lavedan, and when you come to ponder them, you find that you can
      think of nothing. Is it&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo; She put the question very
      timidly, as if half afraid of the answer she might provoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is not so,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paused a moment, and in that moment I wrestled with myself. Confession
      and avowal&mdash;confession of what I had undertaken, and avowal of the
      love that had so unexpectedly come to me&mdash;trembled upon my lips, to
      be driven shuddering away in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I not said that this Bardelys was become a coward? Then my cowardice
      suggested a course to me&mdash;flight. I would leave Lavedan. I would
      return to Paris and to Chatellerault, owning defeat and paying my wager.
      It was the only course open to me. My honour, so tardily aroused, demanded
      no less. Yet, not so much because of that as because it was suddenly
      revealed to me as the easier course, did I determine to pursue it. What
      thereafter might become of me I did not know, nor in that hour of my
      heart&rsquo;s agony did it seem to matter overmuch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is much, mademoiselle, much, indeed, to hold me firmly at Lavedan,&rdquo;
       I pursued at last. &ldquo;But my&mdash;my obligations demand of me that I
      depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the Cause,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But, believe me, you can do nothing. To
      sacrifice yourself cannot profit it. Infinitely better you can serve the
      Duke by waiting until the time is ripe for another blow. And how can you
      better preserve your life than by remaining at Lavedan until the
      persecutions are at an end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of the Cause, mademoiselle, but of myself alone&mdash;of
      my own personal honour. I would that I could explain; but I am afraid,&rdquo; I
      ended lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; she echoed, now raising her eyes in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, afraid. Afraid of your contempt, of your scorn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wonder in her glance increased and asked a question that I could not
      answer. I stretched forward, and caught one of the hands lying idle in her
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne,&rdquo; I murmured very gently, and my tone, my touch, and the use of
      her name drove her eyes for refuge behind their lids again. A flush spread
      upon the ivory pallor of her face, to fade as swiftly, leaving it very
      white. Her bosom rose and fell in agitation, and the little hand I held
      trembled in my grasp. There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Not that I had need to
      think or choose my words. But there was a lump in my throat&mdash;aye, I
      take no shame in confessing it, for this was the first time that a good
      and true emotion had been vouchsafed me since the Duchesse de Bourgogne
      had shattered my illusions ten years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne,&rdquo; I resumed presently, when I was more master of myself, &ldquo;we
      have been good friends, you and I, since that night when I climbed for
      shelter to your chamber, have we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes, monsieur,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten days ago it is. Think of it&mdash;no more than ten days. And it seems
      as if I had been months at Lavedan, so well have we become acquainted. In
      these ten days we have formed opinions of each other. But with this
      difference, that whilst mine are right, yours are wrong. I have come to
      know you for the sweetest, gentlest saint in all this world. Would to God
      I had known you earlier! It might have been very different; I might have
      been&mdash;I would have been&mdash;different, and I would not have done
      what I have done. You have come to know me for an unfortunate but honest
      gentleman. Such am I not. I am under false colours here, mademoiselle.
      Unfortunate I may be&mdash;at least, of late I seem to have become so.
      Honest I am not&mdash;I have not been. There, child, I can tell you no
      more. I am too great a coward. But when later you shall come to hear the
      truth&mdash;when, after I am gone, they may tell you a strange story
      touching this fellow Lesperon who sought the hospitality of your father&rsquo;s
      house&mdash;bethink you of my restraint in this hour; bethink you of my
      departure. You will understand these things perhaps afterwards. But
      bethink you of them, and you will unriddle them for yourself, perhaps. Be
      merciful upon me then; judge me not over-harshly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused, and for a moment we were silent. Then suddenly she looked up;
      her fingers tightened upon mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;of what do speak? You are torturing
      me, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look in my face, Roxalanne. Can you see nothing there of how I am
      torturing myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me, monsieur,&rdquo; she begged, her voice a very caress of suppliant
      softness,&mdash;&ldquo;tell me what vexes you and sets a curb upon your tongue.
      You exaggerate, I am assured. You could do nothing dishonourable, nothing
      vile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I thank God that you are right! I cannot do what is
      dishonourable, and I will not, for all that a month ago I pledged myself
      to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden horror, a doubt, a suspicion flashed into her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you do not mean that you are a spy?&rdquo; she asked; and from my
      heart a prayer of thanks went up to Heaven that this at least it was mine
      frankly to deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not that. I am no spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face cleared again, and she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, I think, the only thing I could not forgive. Since it is not that,
      will you not tell me what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the temptation to confess, to tell her everything, was again
      upon me. But the futility of it appalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; I besought her; &ldquo;you will learn it soon enough.&rdquo; For I was
      confident that once my wager was paid, the news of it and of the ruin of
      Bardelys would spread across the face of France like a ripple over water.
      Presently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me for having come into your life, Roxalanne!&rdquo; I implored her,
      and then I sighed again. &ldquo;Helas! Had I but known you earlier! I did not
      dream such women lived in this worn-out France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not pry, monsieur, since your resolve appears to be so firm. But
      if&mdash;if after I have heard this thing you speak of,&rdquo; she said
      presently, speaking with averted eyes, &ldquo;and if, having heard it, I judge
      you more mercifully than you judge yourself, and I send for you, will you&mdash;will
      you come back to Lavedan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My heart gave a great bound&mdash;a great, a sudden throb of hope. But as
      sudden and as great was the rebound into despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not send for me, be assured of that,&rdquo; I said with finality; and
      we spoke no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the oars and plied them vigorously. I was in haste to end the
      situation. Tomorrow I must think of my departure, and, as I rowed, I
      pondered the words that had passed between us. Not one word of love had
      there been, and yet, in the very omission of it, avowal had lain on either
      side. A strange wooing had been mine&mdash;a wooing that precluded the
      possibility of winning, and yet a wooing that had won. Aye, it had won;
      but it might not take. I made fine distinctions and quaint paradoxes as I
      tugged at my oars, for the human mind is a curiously complex thing, and
      with some of us there is no such spur to humour as the sting of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roxalanne sat white and very thoughtful, but with veiled eyes, so that I
      might guess nothing of what passed within her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we reached the chateau, and as I brought the boat to the terrace
      steps, it was Saint-Eustache who came forward to offer his wrist to
      Mademoiselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted the pallor of her face, and darted me a quick, suspicion-laden
      glance. As we were walking towards the chateau&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; said he in a curious tone, &ldquo;do you know that a
      rumour of your death is current in the province?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped that such a rumour might get abroad when I disappeared,&rdquo; I
      answered calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have taken no single step to contradict it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, since in that rumour may be said to lie my safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, monsieur, voyons. Surely you might at least relieve the
      anxieties the affliction, I might almost say&mdash;of those who are
      mourning you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And who may these be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders and pursed his lips in a curiously deprecatory
      smile. With a sidelong glance at Mademoiselle&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you need that I name Mademoiselle de Marsac?&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood still, my wits busily working, my face impassive under his
      scrutinizing glance. In a flash it came to me that this must be the writer
      of some of the letters Lesperon had given me, the original of the
      miniature I carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was silent, I grew suddenly conscious of another pair of eyes
      observing me, Mademoiselle&rsquo;s. She remembered what I had said, she may have
      remembered how I had cried out the wish that I had met her earlier, and
      she may not have been slow to find an interpretation for my words. I could
      have groaned in my rage at such a misinterpretation. I could have taken
      the Chevalier round to the other side of the chateau and killed him with
      the greatest relish in the world. But I restrained myself, I resigned
      myself to be misunderstood. What choice had I?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Saint-Eustache,&rdquo; said I very coldly, and looking him straight
      between his close-set eyes, &ldquo;I have permitted you many liberties, but
      there is one that I cannot permit any one&mdash;and, much as I honour you,
      I can make no exception in your favour. That is to interfere in my
      concerns and presume to dictate to me the manner in which I shall conduct
      them. Be good enough to bear that in your memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he was all servility. The sneer passed out of his face, the
      arrogance out of his demeanour. He became as full of smiles and capers as
      the meanest sycophant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me, monsieur!&rdquo; he cried, spreading his hands, and with
      the humblest smile in the world. &ldquo;I perceive that I have taken a great
      liberty; yet you have misunderstood its purport. I sought to sound you
      touching the wisdom of a step upon which I have ventured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, monsieur?&rdquo; I asked, throwing back my head, with the scent of
      danger breast high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it upon myself to-day to mention the fact that you are alive and
      well to one who had a right, I thought, to know of it, and who is coming
      hither tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a presumption you may regret,&rdquo; said I between my teeth. &ldquo;To whom
      do you impart this information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your friend, Monsieur de Marsac,&rdquo; he answered, and through his mask of
      humility the sneer was again growing apparent. &ldquo;He will be here tomorrow,&rdquo;
       he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marsac was that friend of Lesperon&rsquo;s to whose warm commendation of the
      Gascon rebel I owed the courtesy and kindness that the Vicomte de Lavedan
      had meted out to me since my coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it wonderful that I stood as if frozen, my wits refusing to work and my
      countenance wearing, I doubt not, a very stricken look? Here was one
      coming to Lavedan who knew Lesperon&mdash;one who would unmask me and say
      that I was an impostor. What would happen then? A spy they would of a
      certainty account me, and that they would make short work of me I never
      doubted. But that was something that troubled me less than the opinion
      Mademoiselle must form. How would she interpret what I had said that day?
      In what light would she view me hereafter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such questions sped like swift arrows through my mind, and in their train
      came a dull anger with myself that I had not told her everything that
      afternoon. It was too late now. The confession would come no longer of my
      own free will, as it might have done an hour ago, but would be forced from
      me by the circumstances that impended. Thus it would no longer have any
      virtue to recommend it to her mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The news seems hardly welcome, Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; said Roxalanne in a
      voice that was inscrutable. Her tone stirred me, for it betokened
      suspicion already. Something might yet chance to aid me, and in the mean
      while I might spoil all did I yield to this dread of the morrow. By an
      effort I mastered myself, and in tones calm and level, that betrayed
      nothing of the tempest in my soul&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not welcome, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I have excellent reasons
      for not desiring to meet Monsieur de Marsac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, indeed, are they!&rdquo; lisped Saint-Eustache, with an ugly droop
      at the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;I doubt not you&rsquo;ll find it hard to offer a
      plausible reason for having left him and his sister without news that you
      were alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said I at random, &ldquo;why will you drag in his sister&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he echoed, and he eyed me with undisguised amusement. He was
      standing erect, his head thrown back, his right arm outstretched from the
      shoulder, and his hand resting lightly upon the gold mount of his
      beribboned cane. He let his eyes wander from me to Roxalanne, then back
      again to me. At last: &ldquo;Is it wonderful that I should drag in the name of
      your betrothed?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But perhaps you will deny that Mademoiselle de
      Marsac is that to you?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I, forgetting for the moment the part I played and the man whose
      identity I had put on, made answer hotly: &ldquo;I do deny it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, you lie,&rdquo; said he, and shrugged hits shoulders with insolent
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all my life I do not think it could be said of me that I had ever given
      way to rage. Rude, untutored minds may fall a prey to passion, but a
      gentleman, I hold, is never angry. Nor was I then, so far as the outward
      signs of anger count. I doffed my hat with a sweep to Roxalanne, who stood
      by with fear and wonder blending in her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you will forgive that I find it necessary to birch this
      babbling schoolboy in your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the pleasantest manner in the world, I stepped aside, and
      plucked the cane from the Chevalier&rsquo;s hand before he had so much as
      guessed what I was about. I bowed before him with the utmost politeness,
      as if craving his leave and tolerance for what I was about to do, and
      then, before he had recovered from his astonishment, I had laid that cane
      three times in quick succession across his shoulders. With a cry at once
      of pain and of mortification, he sprang back, and his hand dropped to his
      hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; Roxalanne cried to him, &ldquo;do you not see that he is unarmed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he saw nothing, or, if he saw, thanked Heaven that things were in such
      case, and got his sword out. Thereupon Roxalanne would have stepped
      between us, but with arm outstretched I restrained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said I very quietly; for if the wrist that
      had overcome La Vertoile were not with a stick a match for a couple of
      such swords as this coxcomb&rsquo;s, then was I forever shamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bore down upon me furiously, his point coming straight for my throat. I
      took the blade on the cane; then, as he disengaged and came at me lower, I
      made counter-parry, and pursuing the circle after I had caught his steel,
      I carried it out of his hand. It whirled an instant, a shimmering wheel of
      light, then it clattered against the marble balustrade half a dozen yards
      away. With his sword it seemed that his courage, too, departed, and he
      stood at my mercy, a curious picture of foolishness, surprise, and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Chevalier de Saint-Eustache was a young man, and in the young we
      can forgive much. But to forgive such an act as he had been guilty of&mdash;that
      of drawing his sword upon a man who carried no weapons&mdash;would have
      been not only a ridiculous toleration, but an utter neglect of duty. As an
      older man it behoved me to read the Chevalier a lesson in manners and
      gentlemanly feeling. So, quite dispassionately, and purely for his own
      future good, I went about the task, and administered him a thrashing that
      for thoroughness it would be hard to better. I was not discriminating. I
      brought my cane down with a rhythmical precision, and whether it took him
      on the head, the back, or the shoulders, I held to be more his affair than
      mine. I had a moral to inculcate, and the injuries he might receive in the
      course of it were inconsiderable details so that the lesson was borne in
      upon his soul. Two or three times he sought to close with me, but I eluded
      him; I had no mind to descend to a vulgar exchange of blows. My object was
      not to brawl, but to administer chastisement, and this object I may claim
      to have accomplished with a fair degree of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Roxalanne interfered; but only when one blow a little more
      violent, perhaps, than its precursors resulted in the sudden snapping of
      the cane and Monsieur de Eustache&rsquo;s utter collapse into a moaning heap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deplore, mademoiselle, to have offended your sight with such a
      spectacle, but unless these lessons are administered upon the instant
      their effect is not half so salutary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He deserved it, monsieur,&rdquo; said she, with a note almost of fierceness in
      her voice. And of such poor mettle are we that her resentment against that
      groaning mass of fopperies and wheals sent a thrill of pleasure through
      me. I walked over to the spot where his sword had fallen, and picked it
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Saint-Eustache,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have so dishonoured this blade
      that I do not think you would care to wear it again.&rdquo; Saying which, I
      snapped it across my knee, and flung it far out into the river, for all
      that the hilt was a costly one, richly wrought in bronze and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his livid countenance, and his eyes blazed impotent fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Par la mort Dieu!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, &ldquo;you shall give me satisfaction for
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you account yourself still unsatisfied, I am at your service when you
      will,&rdquo; said I courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, before more could be said, I saw Monsieur de Lavedan and the
      Vicomtesse approaching hurriedly across the parterre. The Vicomte&rsquo;s brow
      was black with what might have appeared anger, but which I rightly
      construed into apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has taken place? What have you done?&rdquo; he asked of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has brutally assaulted the Chevalier,&rdquo; cried Madame shrilly, her eyes
      malevolently set upon me. &ldquo;He is only a child, this poor Saint-Eustache,&rdquo;
       she reproached me. &ldquo;I saw it all from my window, Monsieur de Lesperon. It
      was brutal; it was cowardly. So to beat a boy! Shame! If you had a quarrel
      with him, are there not prescribed methods for their adjustment between
      gentlemen? Pardieu, could you not have given him proper satisfaction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If madame will give herself the trouble of attentively examining this
      poor Saint-Eustache,&rdquo; said I, with a sarcasm which her virulence prompted,
      &ldquo;you will agree, I think, that I have given him very proper and very
      thorough satisfaction. I would have met him sword in hand, but the
      Chevalier has the fault of the very young&mdash;he is precipitate; he was
      in too great a haste, and he could not wait until I got a sword. So I was
      forced to do what I could with a cane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you provoked him,&rdquo; she flashed back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever told you so has misinformed you, madame. On the contrary, he
      provoked me. He gave me the lie. I struck him&mdash;could I do less?&mdash;and
      he drew. I defended myself, and I supplemented my defence by a caning, so
      that this poor Saint-Eustache might realize the unworthiness of what he
      had done. That is all, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was not so easily to be appeased, not even when Mademoiselle and
      the Vicomte joined their voices to mine in extenuation of my conduct. It
      was like Lavedan. For all that he was full of dread of the result and of
      the vengeance Saint-Eustache might wreak&mdash;boy though he was&mdash;he
      expressed himself freely touching the Chevalier&rsquo;s behaviour and the
      fittingness of the punishment that had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomtesse stood in small awe of her husband, but his judgment upon a
      point of honour was a matter that she would not dare contest. She was
      ministering to the still prostrate Chevalier who, I think, remained
      prostrate now that he might continue to make appeal to her sympathy&mdash;when
      suddenly she cut in upon Roxalanne&rsquo;s defence of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; she demanded suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; answered the Vicomtesse impatiently. &ldquo;The Chevalier was
      waiting two hours for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roxalanne coloured to the roots of her hair. The Vicomte frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting for me, my mother? But why for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer my question&mdash;where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was with Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; she answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; the Vicomtesse almost shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes.&rdquo; The poor child&rsquo;s tones were laden with wonder at this
      catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s death!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;It seems that my daughter is no better than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heaven knows what may have been coming, for she had the most virulent,
      scandalous tongue that I have ever known in a woman&rsquo;s head&mdash;which is
      much for one who has lived at Court to say. But the Vicomte, sharing my
      fears, perhaps, and wishing to spare the child&rsquo;s ears, interposed quickly
      &ldquo;Come, madame, what airs are these? What sudden assumption of graces that
      we do not affect? We are not in Paris. This is not the Luxembourg. En
      province comme en province, and here we are simple folk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simple folk?&rdquo; she interrupted, gasping. &ldquo;By God, am I married to a
      ploughman? Am I Vicomtesse of Lavedan, or the wife of a boor of the
      countryside? And is the honour of your daughter a matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The honour of my daughter is not in question, madame,&rdquo; he interrupted in
      his turn, and with a sudden sternness that spent the fire of her
      indignation as a spark that is trampled underfoot. Then, in a calm, level
      voice: &ldquo;Ah, here are the servants,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit them, madame, to take charge of Monsieur de Saint-Eustache.
      Anatole, you had better order the carriage for Monsieur le Chevalier. I do
      not think that he will be able to ride home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anatole peered at the pale young gentleman on the ground, then he turned
      his little wizened face upon me, and grinned in a singularly solemn
      fashion. Monsieur de Saint-Eustache was little loved, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning heavily upon the arm of one of the lacqueys, the Chevalier moved
      painfully towards the courtyard, where the carriage was being prepared for
      him. At the last moment he turned and beckoned the Vicomte to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As God lives, Monsieur de Lavedan,&rdquo; he swore, breathing heavily in the
      fury that beset him, &ldquo;you shall bitterly regret having taken sides to-day
      with that Gascon bully. Remember me, both of you, when you are journeying
      to Toulouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte stood beside him, impassive and unmoved by that grim threat,
      for all that to him it must have sounded like a death-sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur&mdash;a speedy recovery,&rdquo; was all he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I stepped up to them. &ldquo;Do you not think, Vicomte, that it were better
      to detain him?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Let him go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier&rsquo;s eyes met mine in a look of terror. Perhaps already that
      young man repented him of his menace, and he realized the folly of
      threatening one in whose power he still chanced to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bethink you, monsieur,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Yours is a noble and useful life. Mine
      is not without value, either. Shall we suffer these lives&mdash;aye, and
      the happiness of your wife and daughter&mdash;to be destroyed by this
      vermin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go, monsieur; let him go. I am not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed and stepped back, motioning to the lacquey to take the fellow
      away, much as I should have motioned him to remove some uncleanness from
      before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomtesse withdrew in high dudgeon to her chamber, and I did not see
      her again that evening. Mademoiselle I saw once, for a moment, and she
      employed that moment to question me touching the origin of my quarrel with
      Saint-Eustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he really lie, Monsieur de Lesperon?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honour, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I answered solemnly, &ldquo;I have plighted my
      troth to no living woman.&rdquo; Then my chin sank to my breast as I bethought
      me of how tomorrow she must opine me the vilest liar living&mdash;for I
      was resolved to be gone before Marsac arrived&mdash;since the real
      Lesperon I did not doubt was, indeed, betrothed to Mademoiselle de Marsac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave Lavedan betimes to-morrow, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I pursued
      presently. &ldquo;What has happened to-day makes my departure all the more
      urgent. Delay may have its dangers. You will hear strange things of me, as
      already I have warned you. But be merciful. Much will be true, much false;
      yet the truth itself is very vile, and&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped short, in despair
      of explaining or even tempering what had to come. I shrugged my shoulders
      in my abandonment of hope, and I turned towards the window. She crossed
      the room and came to stand beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not tell me? Have you no faith in me? Ah, Monsieur de Lesperon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sh! child, I cannot. It is too late to tell you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not too late! From what you say they will tell me, I should think,
      perhaps, worse of you than you deserve. What is this thing you hide? What
      is this mystery? Tell me, monsieur. Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did ever woman more plainly tell a man she loved him, and that loving him
      she would find all excuses for him? Was ever woman in better case to hear
      a confession from the man that loved her, and of whose love she was
      assured by every instinct that her sex possesses in such matters? Those
      two questions leapt into my mind, and in resolving them I all but
      determined to speak even now in the eleventh hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;I know not how&mdash;a fresh barrier seemed to arise. It
      was not merely a matter of telling her of the wager I was embarked upon;
      not merely a matter of telling her of the duplicity that I had practised,
      of the impostures by which I had gained admittance to her father&rsquo;s
      confidence and trust; not merely a matter of confessing that I was not
      Lesperon. There would still be the necessity of saying who I was. Even if
      she forgave all else, could she forgive me for being Bardelys the
      notorious Bardelys, the libertine, the rake, some of whose exploits she
      had heard of from her mother, painted a hundred times blacker than they
      really were? Might she not shrink from me when I told her I was that man?
      In her pure innocence she deemed, no doubt, that the life of every man who
      accounted himself a gentleman was moderately clean. She would not see in
      me&mdash;as did her mother&mdash;no more than a type of the best class in
      France, and having no more than the vices of my order. As a monster of
      profligacy might she behold me, and that&mdash;ah, Dieu!&mdash;I could not
      endure that she should do whilst I was by.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be&mdash;indeed, now, as I look back, I know that I exaggerated my
      case. I imagined she would see it as I saw it then. For would you credit
      it? With this great love that was now come to me, it seemed the ideals of
      my boyhood were returned, and I abhorred the man that I had been. The life
      I had led now filled me with disgust and loathing; the notions I had
      formed seemed to me now all vicious and distorted, my cynicism shallow and
      unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; she called softly to me, noting my silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to her. I set my hand lightly upon her arm; I let my gaze
      encounter the upward glance of her eyes&mdash;blue as forget-me-nots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suffer!&rdquo; she murmured, with sweet compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse, Roxalanne! I have sown in your heart too the seed of suffering.
      Oh, I am too unworthy!&rdquo; I cried out; &ldquo;and when you come to discover how
      unworthy it will hurt you; it will sting your pride to think how kind you
      were to me.&rdquo; She smiled incredulously, in denial of my words. &ldquo;No, child;
      I cannot tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, and then before more could be said there was a sound at the
      door, and we started away from each other. The Vicomte entered, and my
      last chance of confessing, of perhaps averting much of what followed, was
      lost to me.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE PORTRAIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Into the mind of every thoughtful man must come at times with bitterness
      the reflection of how utterly we are at the mercy of Fate, the victims of
      her every whim and caprice. We may set out with the loftiest, the sternest
      resolutions to steer our lives along a well-considered course, yet the
      slightest of fortuitous circumstances will suffice to force us into a
      direction that we had no thought of taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, had it pleased Monsieur de Marsac to have come to Lavedan at any
      reasonable hour of the day, I should have been already upon the road to
      Paris, intent to own defeat and pay my wager. A night of thought, besides
      strengthening my determination to follow such a course, had brought the
      reflection that I might thereafter return to Roxalanne, a poor man, it is
      true, but one at least whose intentions might not be misconstrued.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, when at last I sank into sleep, my mind was happier than it had
      been for many days. Of Roxalanne&rsquo;s love I was assured, and it seemed that
      I might win her, after all, once I removed the barrier of shame that now
      deterred me. It may be that those thoughts kept me awake until a late
      hour, and that to this I owe it that when on the morrow I awakened the
      morning was well advanced. The sun was flooding my chamber, and at my
      bedside stood Anatole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; I inquired, sitting bolt upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Past ten,&rdquo; said he, with stern disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have let me sleep?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do little else at Lavedan even when we are awake,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;There
      was no reason why monsieur should rise.&rdquo; Then, holding out a paper,
      &ldquo;Monsieur Stanislas de Marsac was here betimes this morning with
      Mademoiselle his sister. He left this letter for you, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amaze and apprehension were quickly followed by relief, since Anatole&rsquo;s
      words suggested that Marsac had not remained. I took the letter,
      nevertheless, with some misgivings, and whilst I turned it over in my
      hands I questioned the old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stayed an hour at the chateau, monsieur,&rdquo; Anatole informed me.
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Vicomte would have had you roused, but he would not hear of
      it. &lsquo;If what Monsieur de Saint-Eustache has told me touching your guest
      should prove to be true,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I would prefer not to meet him under
      your roof, monsieur.&rsquo; &lsquo;Monsieur de Saint-Eustache,&rsquo; my master replied, &lsquo;is
      not a person whose word should have weight with any man of honour.&rsquo; But in
      spite of that, Monsieur de Marsac held to his resolve, and although he
      would offer no explanation in answer to my master&rsquo;s many questions, you
      were not aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the end of a half-hour his sister entered with Mademoiselle. They had
      been walking together on the terrace, and Mademoiselle de Marsac appeared
      very angry. &lsquo;Affairs are exactly as Monsieur de Saint-Eustache has
      represented them,&rsquo; said she to her brother. At that he swore a most
      villainous oath, and called for writing materials. At the moment of his
      departure he desired me to deliver this letter to you, and then rode away
      in a fury, and, seemingly, not on the best of terms with Monsieur le
      Vicomte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his sister?&rdquo; I asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went with him. A fine pair, as I live!&rdquo; he added, casting his eyes to
      the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least I could breathe freely. They were gone, and whatever damage they
      may have done to the character of poor Rene de Lesperon ere they departed,
      they were not there, at all events, to denounce me for an impostor. With a
      mental apology to the shade of the departed Lesperon for all the discredit
      I was bringing down upon his name, I broke the seal of that momentous
      epistle, which enclosed a length of some thirty-two inches of string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur [I read], wherever I may chance to meet you it shall be my duty
      to kill you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rich beginning, in all faith! If he could but maintain that
      uncompromising dramatic flavour to the end, his epistle should be worth
      the trouble of deciphering, for he penned a vile scrawl of pothooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is because of this [the letter proceeded] that I have refrained from
      coming face to face with you this morning. The times are too troublous and
      the province is in too dangerous a condition to admit of an act that might
      draw the eyes of the Keeper of the Seals upon Lavedan. To my respect,
      then, to Monsieur le Vicomte and to my own devotion to the Cause we
      mutually serve do you owe it that you still live. I am on my way to Spain
      to seek shelter there from the King&rsquo;s vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save myself is a duty that I owe as much to myself as to the Cause. But
      there is another duty, one that I owe my sister, whom you have so
      outrageously slighted, and this duty, by God&rsquo;s grace, I will perform
      before I leave. Of your honour, monsieur, we will not speak, for reasons
      into which I need not enter, and I make no appeal to it. But if you have a
      spark of manhood left, if you are not an utter craven as well as a knave,
      I shall expect you on the day after tomorrow, at any hour before noon, at
      the Auberge de la Couronne at Grenade. There, monsieur, if you please, we
      will adjust our differences. That you may come prepared, and so that no
      time need be wasted when we meet, I send you the length of my sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended that angry, fire-breathing epistle. I refolded it thoughtfully,
      then, having taken my resolve, I leapt from the bed and desired Anatole to
      assist me to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the Vicomte much exercised in mind as to the meaning of Marsac&rsquo;s
      extraordinary behaviour, and I was relieved to see that he, at least,
      could conjecture no cause for it. In reply to the questions with which he
      very naturally assailed me, I assured him that it was no more than a
      matter of a misunderstanding; that Monsieur de Marsac had asked me to meet
      him at Grenade in two days&rsquo; time, and that I should then, no doubt, be
      able to make all clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, I regretted the incident, since it necessitated my remaining
      and encroaching for two days longer upon the Vicomte&rsquo;s hospitality. To all
      this, however, he made the reply that I expected, concluding with the
      remark that for the present at least it would seem as if the Chevalier de
      Saint-Eustache had been satisfied with creating this trouble betwixt
      myself and Marsac.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what Anatole had said, I had already concluded that Marsac had
      exercised the greatest reticence. But the interview between his sister and
      Roxalanne filled me with the gravest anxiety. Women are not wont to
      practise the restraint of men under such circumstances, and for all that
      Mademoiselle de Marsac may not have expressed it in so many words that I
      was her faithless lover, yet women are quick to detect and interpret the
      signs of disorders springing from such causes, and I had every fear that
      Roxalanne was come to the conclusion that I had lied to her yesternight.
      With an uneasy spirit, then, I went in quest of her, and I found her
      walking in the old rose garden behind the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not at first remark my approach, and I had leisure for some
      moments to observe her and to note the sadness that dwelt in her profile
      and the listlessness of her movements. This, then, was my work&mdash;mine,
      and that of Monsieur de Chatellerault, and those other merry gentlemen who
      had sat at my table in Paris nigh upon a month ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      I moved, and the gravel crunched under my foot, whereupon she turned, and,
      at sight of me advancing towards her, she started. The blood mounted to
      her face, to ebb again upon the instant, leaving it paler than it had
      been. She made as if to depart; then she appeared to check herself, and
      stood immovable and outwardly calm, awaiting my approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her eyes were averted, and her bosom rose and fell too swiftly to lend
      colour to that mask of indifference she hurriedly put on. Yet, as I drew
      nigh, she was the first to speak, and the triviality of her words came as
      a shock to me, and for all my knowledge of woman&rsquo;s way caused me to doubt
      for a moment whether perhaps her calm were not real, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a laggard this morning, Monsieur de Lesperon.&rdquo; And, with a half
      laugh, she turned aside to break a rose from its stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; I answered stupidly; &ldquo;I slept over-late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pities, since thus you missed seeing Mademoiselle de Marsac.
      Have they told you that she was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle. Stanislas de Marsac left a letter for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will regret not having seen them, no doubt?&rdquo; quoth she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I evaded the interrogative note in her voice. &ldquo;That is their fault. They
      appear to have preferred to avoid me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it matter for wonder?&rdquo; she flashed, with a sudden gleam of fury which
      she as suddenly controlled. With the old indifference, she added, &ldquo;You do
      not seem perturbed, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, mademoiselle; I am very deeply perturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At not having seen your betrothed?&rdquo; she asked, and now for the first time
      her eyes were raised, and they met mine with a look that was a stab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I had the honour of telling you yesterday that I had
      plighted my troth to no living woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that reminder of yesterday she winced, and I was sorry that I had
      uttered it, for it must have set the wound in her pride a-bleeding again.
      Yesterday I had as much as told her that I loved her, and yesterday she
      had as much as answered me that she loved me, for yesterday I had sworn
      that Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s story of my betrothal was a lie. To-day she had had
      assurance of the truth from the very woman to whom Lesperon&rsquo;s faith was
      plighted, and I could imagine something of her shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered contemptuously, &ldquo;you lied in many
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I spoke the truth in all. Oh, God in heaven, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I
      exclaimed in sudden passion, &ldquo;will you not believe me? Will you not accept
      my word for what I say, and have a little patience until I shall have
      discharged such obligations as will permit me to explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain?&rdquo; quoth she, with withering disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a hideous misunderstanding in all this. I am the victim of a
      miserable chain of circumstances. Oh, I can say no more! These Marsacs I
      shall easily pacify. I am to meet Monsieur de Marsac at Grenade on the day
      after to-morrow. In my pocket I have a letter from this living
      sword-blade, in which he tells me that he will give himself the pleasure
      of killing me then. Yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he does, monsieur!&rdquo; she cut in, with a fierceness before which I
      fell dumb and left my sentence unfinished. &ldquo;I shall pray God that he may!&rdquo;
       she added. &ldquo;You deserve it as no man deserved it yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I stood stricken, indeed, by her words. Then, my reason
      grasping the motive of that fierceness, a sudden joy pervaded me. It was a
      fierceness breathing that hatred that is a part of love, than which, it is
      true, no hatred can be more deadly. And yet so eloquently did it tell me
      of those very feelings which she sought jealously to conceal, that, moved
      by a sudden impulse, I stepped close up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne,&rdquo; I said fervently, &ldquo;you do not hope for it. What would your
      life be if I were dead? Child, child, you love me even as I love you.&rdquo; I
      caught her suddenly to me with infinite tenderness, with reverence almost.
      &ldquo;Can you lend no ear to the voice of this love? Can you not have faith in
      me a little? Can you not think that if I were quite as unworthy as you
      make-believe to your very self, this love could have no place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has no place!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You lie&mdash;as in all things else. I do
      not love you. I hate you. Dieu! How I hate you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had lain in my arms until then, with upturned face and piteous,
      frightened eyes&mdash;like a bird that feels itself within the toils of a
      snake, yet whose horror is blent with a certain fascination. Now, as she
      spoke, her will seemed to reassert itself, and she struggled to break from
      me. But as her fierceness of hatred grew, so did my fierceness of resolve
      gain strength, and I held her tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you hate me?&rdquo; I asked steadily. &ldquo;Ask yourself, Roxalanne, and tell
      me what answer your heart makes. Does it not answer that indeed you do not
      hate me&mdash;that you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God, to be so insulted!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;Will you not release me,
      miserable? Must I call for help? Oh, you shall suffer for this! As there
      is a Heaven, you shall be punished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in my passion I held her, despite entreaties, threats, and struggles.
      I was brutal, if you will. Yet think of what was in my soul at being so
      misjudged, at finding myself in this position, and deal not over harshly
      with me. The courage to confess which I had lacked for days, came to me
      then. I must tell her. Let the result be what it might, it could not be
      worse than this, and this I could endure no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Roxalanne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen! Enough of insults have I heard already. Let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but you shall hear me. I am not Rene de Lesperon. Had these Marsacs
      been less impetuous and foolish, had they waited to have seen me this
      morning, they would have told you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a second in her struggles to regard me. Then, with a sudden
      contemptuous laugh, she renewed her efforts more vigorously than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fresh lies do you offer me? Release me, I will hear no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Heaven is my witness, I have told you the truth. I know how wild a
      sound it has, and that is partly why I did not tell you earlier. But your
      disdain I cannot suffer. That you should deem me a liar in professing to
      love you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her struggles were grown so frantic that I was forced to relax my grip.
      But this I did with a suddenness that threw her out of balance, and she
      was in danger of falling backwards. To save herself, she caught at my
      doublet, which was torn open under the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood some few feet apart, and, white and palpitating in her anger, she
      confronted me. Her eyes lashed me with their scorn, but under my steady,
      unflinching gaze they fell at last. When next she raised them there was a
      smile of quiet but unutterable contempt upon her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you swear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you are not Rene de Lesperon? That
      Mademoiselle de Marsac is not your betrothed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;by my every hope of Heaven!&rdquo; I cried passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to survey me with that quiet smile of mocking scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard it said,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;that the greatest liars are ever those
      that are readiest to take oath.&rdquo; Then, with a sudden gasp of loathing, &ldquo;I
      think you have dropped something, monsieur,&rdquo; said she, pointing to the
      ground. And without waiting for more, she swung round and left me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face upwards at my feet lay the miniature that poor Lesperon had entrusted
      to me in his dying moments. It had dropped from my doublet in the
      struggle, and I never doubted now but that the picture it contained was
      that of Mademoiselle de Marsac.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. A NIGHT ALARM
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was returning that same afternoon from a long walk that I had taken&mdash;for
      my mood was of that unenviable sort that impels a man to be moving&mdash;when
      I found a travelling-chaise drawn up in the quadrangle as if ready for a
      journey. As I mounted the steps of the chateau I came face to face with
      mademoiselle, descending. I drew aside that she might pass; and this she
      did with her chin in the air, and her petticoat drawn to her that it might
      not touch me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have spoken to her, but her eyes looked straight before her with a
      glance that was too forbidding; besides which there was the gaze of a
      half-dozen grooms upon us. So, bowing before her&mdash;the plume of my
      doffed hat sweeping the ground&mdash;I let her go. Yet I remained standing
      where she had passed me, and watched her enter the coach. I looked after
      the vehicle as it wheeled round and rattled out over the drawbridge, to
      raise a cloud of dust on the white, dry road beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that hour I experienced a sense of desolation and a pain to which I
      find it difficult to give expression. It seemed to me as if she had gone
      out of my life for all time&mdash;as if no reparation that I could ever
      make would suffice to win her back after what had passed between us that
      morning. Already wounded in her pride by what Mademoiselle de Marsac had
      told her of our relations, my behaviour in the rose garden had completed
      the work of turning into hatred the tender feelings that but yesterday she
      had all but confessed for me. That she hated me now, I was well assured.
      My reflections as I walked had borne it in upon me how rash, how mad had
      been my desperate action, and with bitterness I realized that I had
      destroyed the last chance of ever mending matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the payment of my wager and my return in my true character could
      avail me now. The payment of my wager, forsooth! Even that lost what
      virtue it might have contained. Where was the heroism of such an act? Had
      I not failed, indeed? And was not, therefore, the payment of my wager
      become inevitable?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fool! fool! Why had I not profited that gentle mood of hers when we had
      drifted down the stream together? Why had I not told her then of the whole
      business from its ugly inception down to the pass to which things were
      come, adding that to repair the evil I was going back to Paris to pay my
      wager, and that when that was done, I would return to ask her to become my
      wife? That was the course a man of sense would have adopted. He would have
      seen the dangers that beset him in my false position, and would have been
      quick to have forestalled them in the only manner possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heigh-ho! It was done. The game was at an end, and I had bungled my part
      of it like any fool. One task remained me&mdash;that of meeting Marsac at
      Grenade and doing justice to the memory of poor Lesperon. What might
      betide thereafter mattered little. I should be ruined when I had settled
      with Chatellerault, and Marcel de Saint-Pol, de Bardelys, that brilliant
      star in the firmament of the Court of France, would suffer an abrupt
      eclipse, would be quenched for all time. But this weighed little with me
      then. I had lost everything that I might have valued&mdash;everything that
      might have brought fresh zest to a jaded, satiated life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later that day I was told by the Vicomte that there was a rumour current
      to the effect that the Marquis de Bardelys was dead. Idly I inquired how
      the rumour had been spread, and he told me that a riderless horse, which
      had been captured a few days ago by some peasants, had been recognized by
      Monsieur de Bardelys&rsquo;s servants as belonging to their master, and that as
      nothing had been seen or heard of him for a fortnight, it was believed
      that he must have met with some mischance. Not even that piece of
      information served to arouse my interest. Let them believe me dead if they
      would. To him that is suffering worse than death to be accounted dead is a
      small matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day passed without incident. Mademoiselle&rsquo;s absence continued and
      I would have questioned the Vicomte concerning it, but a not unnatural
      hesitancy beset me, and I refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow I was to leave Lavedan, but there were no preparations to be
      made, no packing to be done, for during my sojourn there I had been
      indebted to the generous hospitality of the Vicomte for my very apparel.
      We supped quietly together that night the Vicomte and I&mdash;for the
      Vicomtesse was keeping her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I withdrew early to my chamber, and long I lay awake, revolving a gloomy
      future in my mind. I had given no thought to what I should do after having
      offered my explanation to Monsieur de Marsac on the morrow, nor could I
      now bring myself to consider it with any degree of interest. I would
      communicate with Chatellerault to inform him that I accounted my wager
      lost. I would send him my note of hand, making over to him my Picardy
      estates, and I would request him to pay off and disband my servants both
      in Paris and at Bardelys.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for myself, I did not know, and, as I have hinted, I cared but little,
      in what places my future life might lie. I had still a little property by
      Beaugency, but scant inclination to withdraw to it. To Paris I would not
      return; that much I was determined upon; but upon no more. I had thoughts
      of going to Spain. Yet that course seemed no less futile than any other of
      which I could bethink me. I fell asleep at last, vowing that it would be a
      mercy and a fine solution to the puzzle of how to dispose of the future if
      I were to awaken no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was, however, destined to be roused again just as the veil of night was
      being lifted and the chill breath of dawn was upon the world. There was a
      loud knocking at the gates of Lavedan, confused noises of voices, of
      pattering feet, of doors opening and closing within the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rapping at my chamber door, and when I went to open, I found
      the Vicomte on the threshold, nightcapped, in his shirt, and bearing a
      lighted taper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are troopers at the gate!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he entered the room.
      &ldquo;That dog Saint-Eustache has already been at work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all the agitation that must have been besetting him, his manner was
      serene as ever. &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are admitting them&mdash;naturally?&rdquo; said I, inquiry in my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes&rdquo;; and he shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;What could it avail us to
      resist them? Even had I been prepared for it, it would be futile to
      attempt to suffer a siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrapped a dressing-gown about me, for the morning air was chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Vicomte,&rdquo; said I gravely, &ldquo;I heartily deplore that Monsieur
      de Marsac&rsquo;s affairs should have detained me here. But for him, I had left
      Lavedan two days ago. As it is, I tremble for you, but we may at least
      hope that my being taken in your house will draw down no ill results upon
      you. I shall never forgive myself if through my having taken refuge here I
      should have encompassed your destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question of that,&rdquo; he replied, with the quick generosity
      characteristic of the man. &ldquo;This is the work of Saint-Eustache. Sooner or
      later I always feared that it would happen, for sooner or later he and I
      must have come to enmity over my daughter. That knave had me in his power.
      He knew&mdash;being himself outwardly one of us&mdash;to what extent I was
      involved in the late rebellion, and I knew enough of him to be assured
      that if some day he should wish to do me ill, he would never scruple to
      turn traitor. I am afraid, Monsieur de Lesperon, that it is not for you
      alone&mdash;perhaps not for you at all&mdash;that the soldiers have come,
      but for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, before I could answer him, the door was flung wide, and into the
      room, in nightcap and hastily donned robe&mdash;looking a very meagre in
      that disfiguring deshabille&mdash;swept the Vicomtesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she cried to her husband, her strident voice raised in reproach&mdash;&ldquo;see
      to what a pass you have brought us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, Anne!&rdquo; he exclaimed, approaching her and seeking to soothe her; &ldquo;be
      calm, my poor child, and be brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, evading him, she towered, lean and malevolent as a fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm?&rdquo; she echoed contemptuously. &ldquo;Brave?&rdquo; Then a short laugh broke from
      her&mdash;a despairing, mocking, mirthless expression of anger. &ldquo;By God,
      do you add effrontery to your other failings? Dare you bid me be calm and
      brave in such an hour? Have I been warning you fruitlessly these twelve
      months past, that, after disregarding me and deriding my warnings, you
      should bid me be calm now that my fears are realized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of creaking gates below. The Vicomte heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, putting aside his erstwhile tender manner, and speaking
      with a lofty dignity, &ldquo;the troopers have been admitted. Let me entreat you
      to retire. It is not befitting our station&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is our station?&rdquo; she interrupted harshly. &ldquo;Rebels&mdash;proscribed,
      houseless beggars. That is our station, thanks to you and your insane
      meddling with treason. What is to become of us, fool? What is to become of
      Roxalanne and me when they shall have hanged you and have driven us from
      Lavedan? By God&rsquo;s death, a fine season this to talk of the dignity of our
      station! Did I not warn you, malheureux, to leave party faction alone? You
      laughed at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, your memory does me an injustice,&rdquo; he answered in a strangled
      voice. &ldquo;I never laughed at you in all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did as much, at least. Did you not bid me busy myself with women&rsquo;s
      affairs? Did you not bid me leave you to follow your own judgment? You
      have followed it&mdash;to a pretty purpose, as God lives! These gentlemen
      of the King&rsquo;s will cause you to follow it a little farther,&rdquo; she pursued,
      with heartless, loathsome sarcasm. &ldquo;You will follow it as far as the
      scaffold at Toulouse. That, you will tell me, is your own affair. But what
      provision have you made for your wife and daughter? Did you marry me and
      get her to leave us to perish of starvation? Or are we to turn kitchen
      wenches or sempstresses for our livelihood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a groan, the Vicomte sank down upon the bed, and covered his face
      with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God pity me!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of agony&mdash;an agony such as the
      fear of death could never have infused into his brave soul; an agony born
      of the heartlessness of this woman who for twenty years had shared his bed
      and board, and who now in the hour of his adversity failed him so cruelly&mdash;so
      tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she mocked in her bitterness, &ldquo;call upon God to pity you, for I
      shall not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paced the room now, like a caged lioness, her face livid with the fury
      that possessed her. She no longer asked questions; she no longer addressed
      him; oath followed oath from her thin lips, and the hideousness of this
      woman&rsquo;s blasphemy made me shudder. At last there were heavy steps upon the
      stairs, and, moved by a sudden impulse &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;let me prevail
      upon you to restrain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swung round to face me, her dose-set eyes ablaze with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sangdieu! By what right do you&mdash;&rdquo; she began but this was no time to
      let a woman&rsquo;s tongue go babbling on; no time for ceremony; no season for
      making a leg and addressing her with a simper. I caught her viciously by
      the wrist, and with my face close up to hers &ldquo;Folle!&rdquo; I cried, and I&rsquo;ll
      swear no man had ever used the word to her before. She gasped and choked
      in her surprise and rage. Then lowering my voice lest it should reach the
      approaching soldiers: &ldquo;Would you ruin the Vicomte and yourself?&rdquo; I
      muttered. Her eyes asked me a question, and I answered it. &ldquo;How do you
      know that the soldiers have come for your husband? It may be that they are
      seeking me&mdash;and only me. They may know nothing of the Vicomte&rsquo;s
      defection. Shall you, then, be the one to inform them of it by your
      unbridled rantings and your accusations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her jaw fell open in astonishment. This was a side of the question she had
      not considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me prevail upon you, madame, to withdraw and to be of good courage.
      It is more than likely that you alarm yourself without cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to stare at me in her amazement and the confusion that was
      congenital with it, and if there was not time for her to withdraw, at
      least the possibility I had suggested acted as a timely warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment the door opened again, and on the threshold appeared a
      young man in a plumed hat and corselet, carrying a naked sword in one hand
      and a lanthorn in the other. Behind him I caught the gleam of steel from
      the troopers at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of you is Monsieur Rene de Lesperon?&rdquo; he inquired politely, his
      utterance flavoured by a strong Gascon accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood forward. &ldquo;I am known by that name, Monsieur le Capitaine,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me wistfully, apologetically almost, then &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s
      name, Monsieur de Lesperon, I call upon you to yield!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been expecting you. My sword is yonder, monsieur,&rdquo; I replied
      suavely. &ldquo;If you will allow me to dress, I shall be ready to accompany you
      in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and it at once became clear that his business at Lavedan was&mdash;as
      I had suggested to the Vicomtesse might be possible&mdash;with me alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grateful for the readiness of your submission,&rdquo; said this very
      polite gentleman. He was a comely lad, with blue eyes and a good-humoured
      mouth, to which a pair of bristling moustaches sought vainly to impart an
      expression of ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you proceed to dress, monsieur, I have another duty to discharge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Discharge your duty, monsieur,&rdquo; I answered. Whereupon he made a sign to
      his men, and in a moment they were ransacking my garments and effects.
      While this was taking place, he turned to the Vicomte and Vicomtesse, and
      offered them a thousand apologies for having interrupted their slumbers,
      and for so rudely depriving them of their guest. He advanced in his excuse
      the troublous nature of the times, and threw in a bunch of malisons at the
      circumstances which forced upon soldiers the odious duties of the
      tipstaff, hoping that we would think him none the less a gentleman for the
      unsavoury business upon which he was engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my clothes they took the letters addressed to Lesperon which that
      poor gentleman had entrusted to me on the night of his death; and among
      these there was one from the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans himself, which would alone have
      sufficed to have hanged a regiment. Besides these, they took Monsieur de
      Marsac&rsquo;s letter of two days ago, and the locket containing the picture of
      Mademoiselle de Marsac.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers and the portrait they delivered to the Captain, who took them
      with the same air of deprecation tainted with disgust that coloured all
      his actions in connection with my arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this same repugnance for his catchpoll work do I owe it that at the
      moment of setting out he offered to let me ride without the annoyance of
      an escort if I would pass him my parole not to attempt an escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were standing, then, in the hall of the chateau. His men were already
      in the courtyard, and there were only present Monsieur le Vicomte and
      Anatole&mdash;the latter reflecting the look of sorrow that haunted his
      master&rsquo;s face. The Captain&rsquo;s generosity was certainly leading him beyond
      the bounds of his authority, and it touched me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur is very generous,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap de Dieu!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;he had a way of swearing that reminded me of
      my friend Cazalet. &ldquo;It is no generosity, monsieur. It is a desire to make
      this obscene work more congenial to the spirit of a gentleman, which,
      devil take me, I cannot stifle, not for the King himself. And then,
      Monsieur de Lesperon, are we not fellow-countrymen? Are we not Gascons
      both? Pardieu, there is no more respected a name in the whole of Gascony
      than that of Lesperon, and that you belong to so honourable a family is
      alone more than sufficient to warrant such slight favours as it may be in
      my power to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my parole that I will attempt no escape, Monsieur le Capitaine,&rdquo;
       I answered, bowing may acknowledgment of his compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mironsac de Castelroux, of Chateau Rouge in Gascony,&rdquo; he informed
      me, returning my bow. My faith, had he not made a pretty soldier he would
      have made an admirable master of deportment.
    </p>
    <p>
      My leave-taking of Monsieur de Lavedan was brief but cordial; apologetic
      on my part, intensely sympathetic on his. And so I went out alone with
      Castelroux upon the road to Toulouse, his men being ordered to follow in
      half an hour&rsquo;s time and to travel at their leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we cantered along&mdash;Castelroux and I&mdash;we talked of many
      things, and I found him an amusing and agreeable companion. Had my mood
      been other than despairing, the news he gave me might have occasioned me
      some concern; for it seemed that prisoners arraigned for treason and
      participation in the late rising were being very summarily treated. Many
      were never so much as heard in their own defence, the evidence collected
      of their defection being submitted to the Tribunal, and judgment being
      forthwith passed upon them by judges who had no ears for anything they
      might advance in their own favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence of my identity was complete: there was my own admission to
      Castelroux; the evidence of the treason of Lesperon was none the less
      complete; in fact, it was notorious; and there was the Duke&rsquo;s letter found
      amongst my effects. If the judges refused to lend an ear to my assurances
      that I was not Lesperon at all, but the missing Bardelys, my troubles were
      likely to receive a very summary solution. The fear of it, however,
      weighed not over-heavily upon me. I was supremely indifferent. Life was at
      an end so far as I was concerned. I had ruined the one chance of real
      happiness that had ever been held out to me, and if the gentlemen of the
      courts of Toulouse were pleased to send me unheeded to the scaffold, what
      should it signify?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was another matter that did interest me, and that was my
      interview with Marsac. Touching this, I spoke to my captor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a gentleman I wish to see at Grenade this morning. You have
      amongst the papers taken from me a letter making this assignation,
      Monsieur le Capitaine, and I should be indeed grateful if you would
      determine that we shall break our fast there, so that I may have an
      opportunity of seeing him. The matter is to me of the highest importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It concerns&mdash;?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! But the letter is of the nature of a challenge, is it not?
      Naturally, I cannot permit you to endanger your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lest we disappoint the headsman at Toulouse?&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;Have no fear.
      There shall be no duel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am content, monsieur, and you shall see your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and we talked of other things thereafter as we rode in the
      early morning along the Toulouse road. Our conversation found its way, I
      scarce know how, to the topic of Paris and the Court, and when I casually
      mentioned, in passing, that I was well acquainted with the Luxembourg, he
      inquired whether I had ever chanced to meet a young spark of the name of
      Mironsac.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mironsac?&rdquo; I echoed. &ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo; And I was on the point of adding that I
      knew the youth intimately, and what a kindness I had for him, when,
      deeming it imprudent, I contented myself with asking, &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardieu!&rdquo; he swore. &ldquo;The fellow is my cousin. We are both Mironsacs; he
      is Mironsac of Castelvert, whilst I, as you may remember I told you, am
      Mironsac of Castelroux. To distinguish us, he is always known as Mironsac,
      and I as Castelroux. Peste! It is not the only distinction, for while he
      basks in the sunshine of the great world of Paris&mdash;they are wealthy,
      the Mironsacs of Castelvert&mdash;I, a poor devil of a Gascony cadet, am
      playing the catchpoll in Languedoc!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him with fresh interest, for the mention of that dear lad
      Mironsac brought back to my mind the night in Paris on which my
      ill-starred wager had been laid, and I was reminded of how that
      high-minded youth had sought&mdash;when it was too late to reason me out
      of the undertaking by alluding to the dishonour with which in his honest
      eyes it must be fraught.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spoke of his cousin&mdash;Castelroux and I&mdash;and I went so far now
      as to confess that I had some love for the youth, whom I praised in
      unmistakable terms. This inclined to increase the friendliness which my
      young Captain had manifested since my arrest, and I was presently
      emboldened by it to beg of him to add to the many favours that I already
      owed him by returning to me the portrait which his men had subtracted from
      my pocket. It was my wish to return this to Marsac, whilst at the same
      time it would afford corroboration of my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Castelroux made no difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said he, and he produced it. &ldquo;I crave your pardon for not
      having done the thing of my own accord. What can the Keeper of the Seals
      want with that picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and pocketed the locket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lady!&rdquo; he sighed, a note of compassion in his voice. &ldquo;By my soul,
      Monsieur de Lesperon, fine work this for soldiers, is it not? Diable! It
      is enough to turn a gentleman&rsquo;s stomach sour for life, and make him go
      hide himself from the eyes of honest men. Had I known that soldiering
      meant such business, I had thought twice before I adopted it as a career
      for a man of honour. I had remained in Gascony and tilled the earth sooner
      than have lent myself to this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good young friend,&rdquo; I laughed, &ldquo;what you do, you do in the King&rsquo;s
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So does every tipstaff,&rdquo; he answered impatiently, his moustaches
      bristling as the result of the scornful twist he gave his lips. &ldquo;To think
      that I should have a hand in bringing tears to the eyes of that sweet
      lady! Quelle besogne! Bon Dieu, quelle besogne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed at the distress vented in that whimsical Gascon tongue of his,
      whereupon he eyed me in a wonder that was tempered with admiration. For to
      his brave soul a gentleman so stoical as to laugh under such parlous
      circumstances was very properly a gentleman to be admired.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE RISEN DEAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was close upon ten o&rsquo;clock as we rode into the yard of the imposing
      Hotel de la Couronne at Grenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castelroux engaged a private room on the first floor&mdash;a handsome
      chamber overlooking the courtyard&mdash;and in answer to the inquiries
      that I made I was informed by the landlord that Monsieur de Marsac was not
      yet arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My assignation was &lsquo;before noon,&rsquo; Monsieur de Castelroux,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;With
      your permission, I would wait until noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no difficulty. Two hours were of no account. We had all risen very
      early, and he was, himself, he said, entitled to some rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst I stood by the window it came to pass than a very tall,
      indifferently apparelled gentleman issued from the hostelry and halted for
      some moments in conversation with the ostler below. He walked with an
      enfeebled step, and leaned heavily for support upon a stout cane. As he
      turned to reenter the inn I had a glimpse of a face woefully pale, about
      which, as about the man&rsquo;s whole figure, there was a something that was
      familiar&mdash;a something that puzzled me, and on which my mind was still
      dwelling when presently I sat down to breakfast with Castelroux.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been a half-hour later, and, our meal being at an end, we were
      sitting talking&mdash;I growing impatient the while that this Monsieur de
      Marsac should keep me waiting so&mdash;when of a sudden the rattle of
      hoofs drew me once more to the window. A gentleman, riding very
      recklessly, had just dashed through the porte-cochere, and was in the act
      of pulling up his horse. He was a lean, active man, very richly dressed,
      and with a face that by its swarthiness of skin and the sable hue of beard
      and hair looked almost black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are there!&rdquo; he cried, with something between a snarl and a laugh,
      and addressing somebody within the shelter of the porch. &ldquo;Par la mort
      Dieu, I had hardly looked to find you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the recess of the doorway I heard a gasp of amazement and a cry of
      &ldquo;Marsac! You here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So this was the gentleman I was to see! A stable boy had taken his reins,
      and he leapt nimbly to the ground. Into my range of vision hobbled now the
      enfeebled gentleman whom earlier I had noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Stanislas!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I cannot tell you how rejoiced I am to see
      you!&rdquo; and he approached Marsac with arms that were opened as if to embrace
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer surveyed him a moment in wonder, with eyes grown dull. Then
      abruptly raising his hand, he struck the fellow on the breast, and thrust
      him back so violently that but for the stable-boy&rsquo;s intervention he had of
      a certainty fallen. With a look of startled amazement on his haggard face,
      the invalid regarded his assailant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Marsac, he stepped close up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he cried harshly. &ldquo;What is this make-believe feebleness?
      That you are pale, poltroon, I do not wonder! But why these tottering
      limbs? Why this assumption of weakness? Do you look to trick me by these
      signs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you taken leave of your senses?&rdquo; exclaimed the other, a note of
      responsive anger sounding in his voice. &ldquo;Have you gone mad, Stanislas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abandon this pretence,&rdquo; was the contemptuous answer. &ldquo;Two days ago at
      Lavedan, my friend, they informed me how complete was your recovery; from
      what they told us, it was easy to guess why you tarried there and left us
      without news of you. That was my reason, as you may have surmised, for
      writing to you. My sister has mourned you for dead&mdash;was mourning you
      for dead whilst you sat at the feet of your Roxalanne and made love to her
      among the roses of Lavedan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lavedan?&rdquo; echoed the other slowly. Then, raising his voice, &ldquo;what the
      devil are you saying?&rdquo; he blazed. &ldquo;What do I know of Lavedan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a flash it had come to me who that enfeebled gentleman was. Rodenard,
      the blunderer, had been at fault when he had said that Lesperon had
      expired. Clearly he could have no more than swooned; for here, in the
      flesh, was Lesperon himself, the man I had left for dead in that barn by
      Mirepoix.
    </p>
    <p>
      How or where he had recovered were things that at the moment did not
      exercise my mind&mdash;nor have I since been at any pains to unravel the
      mystery of it; but there he was, and for the moment that fact was
      all-sufficing. What complications would come of his presence Heaven alone
      could foretell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put an end to this play-acting!&rdquo; roared the savage Marsac. &ldquo;It will avail
      you nothing. My sister&rsquo;s tears may have weighed lightly with you, but you
      shall pay the price of them, and of the slight you have put upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, Marsac!&rdquo; cried the other, roused to an equal fierceness. &ldquo;Will
      you explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; snarled Marsac, and his sword flashed from his scabbard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      explain. As God lives, I&rsquo;ll explain&mdash;with this!&rdquo; And he whirled his
      blade under the eyes of the invalid. &ldquo;Come, my master, the comedy&rsquo;s played
      out. Cast aside that crutch and draw; draw, man, or, sangdieu, I&rsquo;ll run
      you through as you stand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a commotion below. The landlord and a posse of his satellites&mdash;waiters,
      ostlers, and stableboys&mdash;rushed between them, and sought to restrain
      the bloodthirsty Marsac. But he shook them off as a bull shakes off a pack
      of dogs, and like an angry bull, too, did he stand his ground and bellow.
      In a moment his sweeping sword had cleared a circle about him. In its
      lightning dartings hither and thither at random, it had stung a waiter in
      the calf, and when the fellow saw the blood staining his hose, he added to
      the general din his shrieks that he was murdered. Marsac swore and
      threatened in a breath, and a kitchen wench, from a point of vantage on
      the steps, called shame upon him and abused him roundly for a cowardly
      assassin to assail a poor sufferer who could hardly stand upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po&rsquo; Cap de Dieu!&rdquo; swore Castelroux at my elbow. &ldquo;Saw you ever such an
      ado? What has chanced?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I never stayed to answer him. Unless I acted quickly blood would
      assuredly be shed. I was the one man who could explain matters, and it was
      a mercy for Lesperon that I should have been at hand in the hour of his
      meeting that fire-eater Marsac. I forgot the circumstances in which I
      stood to Castelroux; I forgot everything but the imminent necessity that I
      should intervene. Some seven feet below our window was the roof of the
      porch; from that to the ground it might be some eight feet more. Before my
      Gascon captain knew what I was about, I had swung myself down from the
      window on to the projecting porch. A second later, I created a diversion
      by landing in the midst of the courtyard fray, with the alarmed Castelroux&mdash;who
      imagined that I was escaping&mdash;following by the same unusual road, and
      shouting as he came &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon! Hi! Monsieur de Lesperon!
      Mordieu! Remember your parole, Monsieur de Lesperon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could have been better calculated to stem Marsac&rsquo;s fury; nothing
      could have so predisposed him to lend an ear to what I had to say, for it
      was very evident that Castelroux&rsquo;s words were addressed to me, and that it
      was I whom he called by the name of Lesperon. In an instant I was at
      Marsac&rsquo;s side. But before I could utter a word, &ldquo;What the devil does this
      mean?&rdquo; he asked, eyeing me with fierce suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means, monsieur, that there are more Lesperons than one in France. I
      am the Lesperon who was at Lavedan. If you doubt me, ask this gentleman,
      who arrested me there last night. Ask him, too, why we have halted here.
      Ask him, if you will, to show you the letter that you left at Lavedan
      making an assignation here before noon to-day, which letter I received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suspicion faded from Marsac&rsquo;s eyes, and they grew round with wonder as
      he listened to this prodigious array of evidence. Lesperon looked on in no
      less amazement, yet I am sure from the manner of his glance that he did
      not recognize in me the man that had succoured him at Mirepoix. That,
      after all, was natural enough; for the minds of men in such reduced
      conditions as had been his upon that night are not prone to receive very
      clear impressions, and still less prone to retain such impressions as they
      do receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Marsac could answer me, Castelroux was at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand apologies!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;A fool might have guessed the errand
      that took you so quickly through that window, and none but a fool would
      have suspected you of seeking to escape. It was unworthy in me, Monsieur
      de Lesperon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned to him while those others still stood gaping, and led him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Capitaine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you find it troublesome enough to
      reconcile your conscience with such arrests as you are charged to make, is
      it not so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mordieu!&rdquo; he cried, by way of emphatically assenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, if you should chance to overhear words betraying to you certain
      people whom otherwise you would never suspect of being rebels, your
      soldier&rsquo;s duty would, nevertheless, compel you to apprehend them, would it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, true. I am afraid it would,&rdquo; he answered, with a grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if forewarned that by being present in a certain place you should
      overhear such words, what course would you pursue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avoid it like a pestilence, monsieur,&rdquo; he answered promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Monsieur le Capitaine, may I trespass upon your generosity to
      beseech you to let me take these litigants to our room upstairs, and to
      leave us alone there for a half-hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frankness was my best friend in dealing with Castelroux&mdash;frankness
      and his distaste for the business they had charged him with. As for Marsac
      and Lesperon, they were both eager enough to have the mystery explained,
      and when Castelroux having consented&mdash;I invited them to my chamber,
      they came readily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Monsieur de Lesperon did not recognize me, there was no reason why I
      should enlighten him touching my identity, and every reason why I should
      not. As soon as they were seated, I went to the heart of the matter at
      once and without preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fortnight ago, gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was driven by a pack of dragoons
      across the Garonne. I was wounded in the shoulder and very exhausted, and
      I knocked at the gates of Lavedan to crave shelter. That shelter,
      gentlemen, was afforded me, and when I had announced myself as Monsieur de
      Lesperon, it was all the more cordially because one Monsieur de Marsac,
      who was a friend of the Vicomte de Lavedan, and a partisan in the lost
      cause of Orleans, happened often to have spoken of a certain Monsieur de
      Lesperon as his very dear friend. I have no doubt, gentlemen, that you
      will think harshly of me because I did not enlighten the Vicomte. But
      there were reasons for which I trust you will not press me, since I shall
      find it difficult to answer you with truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is your name Lesperon?&rdquo; cried Lesperon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, monsieur, is a small matter. Whether my name is Lesperon or not, I
      confess to having practised a duplicity upon the Vicomte and his family,
      since I am certainly not the Lesperon whose identity I accepted. But if I
      accepted that identity, monsieur, I also accepted your liabilities, and so
      I think that you should find it in your heart to extend me some measure of
      forgiveness. As Rene de Lesperon, of Lesperon in Gascony, I was arrested
      last night at Lavedan, and, as you may observe, I am being taken to
      Toulouse to stand the charge of high treason. I have not demurred; I have
      not denied in the hour of trouble the identity that served me in my hour
      of need. I am taking the bitter with the sweet, and I assure you,
      gentlemen, that the bitter predominates in a very marked degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this must not be,&rdquo; cried Lesperon, rising. &ldquo;I know not what use you
      may have made of my name, but I have no reason to think that you can have
      brought discredit upon it, and so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, monsieur, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I cannot submit that you shall go to Toulouse in my stead. Where
      is this officer whose prisoner you are? Pray summon him, monsieur, and let
      us set the matter right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very generous,&rdquo; I answered calmly. &ldquo;But I have crimes enough upon
      my head, and so, if the worst should befall me, I am simply atoning in one
      person for the errors of two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is no concern of mine!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so much your concern that if you commit so egregious a blunder as
      to denounce yourself, you will have ruined yourself, without materially
      benefitting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still objected, but in this strain I argued for some time, and to such
      good purpose that in the end I made him realize that by betraying himself
      he would not save me, but only join me on the journey to the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, gentlemen,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;my case is far from hopeless. I have
      every confidence that, as matters stand, by putting forth my hand at the
      right moment, by announcing my identity at the proper season, I can, if I
      am so inclined, save my neck from the headsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are so inclined?&rdquo; they both cried, their looks charged with
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that be,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;it does not at present concern us. What I
      desire you to understand, Monsieur de Lesperon, is that if I go to
      Toulouse alone, when the time comes to proclaim myself, and it is found
      that I am not Rene de Lesperon, of Lesperon in Gascony, they will assume
      that you are dead, and there will be no count against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you come with me, and thereby afford proof that you are alive, my
      impersonation of you may cause me trouble. They may opine that I have been
      an abettor of treason, that I have attempted to circumvent the ends of
      justice, and that I may have impersonated you in order to render possible
      your escape. For that, you may rest assured, they will punish me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see, therefore, that my own safety rests on your passing quietly
      out of France and leaving the belief behind you that you are dead&mdash;a
      belief that will quickly spread once I shall have cast off your identity.
      You apprehend me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaguely, monsieur; and perhaps you are right. What do you say,
      Stanislas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say?&rdquo; cried the fiery Marsac. &ldquo;I am weighed down with shame, my poor
      Rene, for having so misjudged you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More he would have said in the same strain, but Lesperon cut him short and
      bade him attend to the issue now before him. They discussed it at some
      length, but always under the cloud in which my mysteriousness enveloped
      it, and, in the end, encouraged by my renewed assurances that I could best
      save myself if Lesperon were not taken with me, the Gascon consented to my
      proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marsac was on his way to Spain. His sister, he told us, awaited him at
      Carcassonne. Lesperon should set out with him at once, and in forty-eight
      hours they would be beyond the reach of the King&rsquo;s anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a favour to ask of you, Monsieur de Marsac,&rdquo; said I, rising; for
      our business was at an end. &ldquo;It is that if you should have an opportunity
      of communicating with Mademoiselle de Lavedan, you will let her know that
      I am not&mdash;not the Lesperon that is betrothed to your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will inform her of it, monsieur,&rdquo; he answered readily; and then, of a
      sudden, a look of understanding and of infinite pity came into his eyes.
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, monsieur?&rdquo; I asked, staggered by that sudden outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not ask me, monsieur, do not ask me. I had forgotten for the moment,
      in the excitement of all these revelations. But&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to ponder a moment, then looking at me again with that same
      compassionate glance, &ldquo;You had better know,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And yet&mdash;it is
      a difficult thing to tell you. I understand now much that I had not dreamt
      of. You&mdash;you have no suspicion of how you came to be arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my alleged participation in the late rebellion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. But who gave the information of your whereabouts? Who told the
      Keeper of the Seals where you were to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that?&rdquo; I answered easily. &ldquo;Why, I never doubted it. It was the
      coxcomb Saint-Eustache. I whipped him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped short. There was something in Marsac&rsquo;s black face, something in
      his glance, that forced the unspoken truth upon my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother in heaven!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Do you mean that it was Mademoiselle de
      Lavedan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head in silence. Did she hate me, then, so much as that?
      Would nothing less than my death appease her, and had I utterly crushed
      the love that for a little while she had borne me, that she could bring
      herself to hand me over to the headsman?
    </p>
    <p>
      God! What a stab was that! It turned me sick with grief&mdash;aye, and
      with some rage not against her, oh, not against her; against the fates
      that had brought such things to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      I controlled myself while their eyes were yet upon me. I went to the door
      and held it open for them, and they, perceiving something of my disorder,
      were courteous enough to omit the protracted leave-takings that under
      other auspices there might have been. Marsac paused a moment on the
      threshold as if he would have offered me some word of comfort. Then,
      perceiving, perhaps, how banal must be all comfort that was of words
      alone, and how it might but increase the anger of the wound it was meant
      to balm, he sighed a simple &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur!&rdquo; and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, I returned to the table, and, sitting down, I buried
      my head in my arms, and there I lay, a prey to the most poignant grief
      that in all my easy, fortunate life I had ever known. That she should have
      done this thing! That the woman I loved, the pure, sweet, innocent girl
      that I had wooed so ardently in my unworthiness at Lavedan, should have
      stooped to such an act of betrayal! To what had I not reduced her, since
      such things could be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, out of my despair grew comfort, slowly at first, and more vigorously
      anon. The sudden shock of the news had robbed me of some of my wit, and
      had warped my reasoning. Later, as the pain of the blow grew duller, I
      came to reflect that what she had done was but a proof&mdash;an
      overwhelming proof&mdash;of how deeply she had cared. Such hatred as this
      can be but born of a great love; reaction is ever to be measured by the
      action that occasions it, and a great revulsion can only come of a great
      affection. Had she been indifferent to me, or had she but entertained for
      me a passing liking, she would not have suffered so.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I came to realize how cruel must have been the pang that had driven
      her to this. But she had loved me; aye, and she loved me still, for all
      that she thought she hated, and for all that she had acted as if she
      hated. But even if I were wrong&mdash;even if she did hate me&mdash;what a
      fresh revulsion would not be hers when anon she learnt that&mdash;whatever
      my sins&mdash;I had not played lightly with her love; that I was not, as
      she had imagined, the betrothed of another woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought fired me like wine. I was no longer listless&mdash;no longer
      indifferent as to whether I lived or died. I must live. I must enlighten
      the Keeper of the Seals and the judges at Toulouse concerning my identity.
      Why, indeed, had I ever wavered? Bardelys the Magnificent must come to
      life again, and then&mdash;What then?
    </p>
    <p>
      As suddenly as I had been exalted was I cast down. There was a rumour
      abroad that Bardelys was dead. In the wake of that rumour I shrewdly
      guessed that the report of the wager that had brought him into Languedoc
      would not be slow to follow. What then? Would she love me any the better?
      Would she hate me any the less? If now she was wounded by the belief that
      I had made sport of her love, would not that same belief be with her again
      when she came to know the truth?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye, the tangle was a grievous one. Yet I took heart. My old resolve
      returned to me, and I saw the need for urgency&mdash;in that alone could
      lie now my redemption in her eyes. My wager must be paid before I again
      repaired to her, for all that it should leave me poor indeed. In the mean
      while, I prayed God that she might not hear of it ere I returned to tell
      her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE KING&rsquo;S COMMISSIONER
    </h2>
    <p>
      For that most amiable of Gascon cadets, Monsieur de Castelroux, I have
      naught but the highest praise. In his every dealing with me he revealed
      himself so very gallant, generous, and high-minded a gentleman that it was
      little short of a pleasure to be his prisoner. He made no inquiries
      touching the nature of my interview with those two gentlemen at the Hotel
      de la Couronne, and when at the moment of leaving I requested him to
      deliver a packet to the taller of those same two he did so without comment
      or question. That packet contained the portrait of Mademoiselle de Marsac,
      but on the inner wrapper was a note requesting Lesperon not to open it
      until he should be in Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Marsac nor Lesperon did I see again before we resumed our journey
      to Toulouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment of setting out a curious incident occurred. Castelroux&rsquo;s
      company of dragoons had ridden into the courtyard as we were mounting.
      They lined up under their lieutenant&rsquo;s command, to allow us to pass; but
      as we reached the porte-cochere we were delayed for a moment by a
      travelling-carriage, entering for relays, and coming, apparently, from
      Toulouse. Castelroux and I backed our horses until we were in the midst of
      the dragoons, and so we stood while the vehicle passed in. As it went by,
      one of the leather curtains was drawn back, and my heart was quickened by
      the sight of a pale girl face, with eyes of blue, and brown curls lying
      upon the slender neck. Her glance lighted on me, swordless and in the
      midst of that company of troopers, and I bowed low upon the withers of my
      horse, doffing my hat in distant salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain dropped again, and eclipsed the face of the woman that had
      betrayed me. With my mind full of wild surmisings as to what emotions
      might have awakened in her upon beholding me, I rode away in silence at
      Monsieur de Castelroux&rsquo;s side. Had she experienced any remorse? Any shame?
      Whether or not such feelings had been aroused at sight of me, it certainly
      would not be long ere she experienced them, for at the Hotel de la
      Couronne were those who would enlighten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contemplation of the remorseful grief that might anon beset her when
      she came to ponder the truth of matters, and, with that truth, those
      things that at Lavedan I had uttered, filled me presently with regret and
      pity. I grew impatient to reach Toulouse and tell the judges of the
      mistake that there had been. My name could not be unknown to them, and the
      very mention of it, I thought, should suffice to give them pause and lead
      them to make inquiries before sending me to the scaffold. Yet I was not
      without uneasiness, for the summariness with which Castelroux had informed
      me they were in the habit of dealing with those accused of high treason
      occasioned me some apprehensive pangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This apprehension led me to converse with my captor touching those trials,
      seeking to gather from him who were the judges. I learnt then that besides
      the ordinary Tribunal, a Commissioner had been dispatched by His Majesty,
      and was hourly expected to arrive at Toulouse. It would be his mission to
      supervise and direct the inquiries that were taking place. It was said, he
      added, that the King himself was on his way thither, to be present at the
      trial of Monsieur le Duc de Montmorency. But he was travelling by easy
      stages, and was not yet expected for some days. My heart, which had leapt
      at the news, as suddenly sank again with the consideration that I should
      probably be disposed of before the King&rsquo;s arrival. It would behoove me,
      therefore, to look elsewhere for help and for some one to swear to my
      identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name of this King&rsquo;s Commissioner?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a certain Comte de Chatellerault, a gentleman man said to stand
      very high in His Majesty&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatellerault!&rdquo; I cried in wondering joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most excellently!&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;We are very intimately acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, monsieur, I augur you this gentleman&rsquo;s friendship, and that it
      may pilot you through your trouble. Although&mdash;&rdquo; Being mercifully
      minded, he stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I laughed easily. &ldquo;Indeed, my dear Captain, I think it will,&rdquo; said I;
      &ldquo;although friendship in this world is a thing of which the unfortunate
      know little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I rejoiced too soon, as you shall hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rode diligently on, our way lying along the fertile banks of the
      Garonne, now yellow with the rustling corn. Towards evening we made our
      last halt at Fenouillet, whence a couple of hours&rsquo; riding should bring us
      to Toulouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the post-house we overtook a carriage that seemingly had halted for
      relays, but upon which I scarce bestowed a glance as I alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Castelroux went to arrange for fresh horses, I strode into the
      common room, and there for some moments I stood discussing the viands with
      our host. When at last I had resolved that a cold pasty and a bottle of
      Armagnac would satisfy our wants, I looked about me to take survey of
      those in the room. One group in a remote corner suddenly riveted my
      attention to such a degree that I remained deaf to the voice of
      Castelroux, who had just entered, and who stood now beside me. In the
      centre of this group was the Comte de Chatellerault himself, a thick-set,
      sombre figure, dressed with that funereal magnificence he affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not the sight of him that filled me with amazement. For that,
      Castelroux&rsquo;s information had prepared me, and I well understood in what
      capacity he was there. My surprise sprang rather from the fact that
      amongst the half-dozen gentlemen about him&mdash;and evidently in
      attendance&mdash;I beheld the Chevalier de Saint-Eustache. Now, knowing as
      I did, the Chevalier&rsquo;s treasonable leanings, there was ample cause for my
      astonishment at finding him in such company. Apparently, too, he was on
      very intimate terms with the Count, for in raising my glance I had caught
      him in the act of leaning over to whisper familiarly in Chatellerault&rsquo;s
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes&mdash;indeed, for that matter the eyes of the entire company&mdash;were
      turned in my direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was not a surprising thing that Chatellerault should gaze upon
      me in that curious fashion, for was it not probable that he had heard that
      I was dead? Besides, the fact that I was without a sword, and that at my
      side stood a King&rsquo;s officer, afforded evidence enough of my condition, and
      well might Chatellerault stare at beholding me so manifestly a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as I watched him, he appeared to start at something that
      Saint-Eustache was saying, and a curious change spread over his face. Its
      whilom expression had been rather one of dismay; for, having believed me
      dead, he no doubt accounted his wager won, whereas seeing me alive had
      destroyed that pleasant conviction. But now it took on a look of relief
      and of something that suggested malicious cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Castelroux in my ear, &ldquo;is the King&rsquo;s commissioner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did I not know it? I never waited to answer him, but, striding across the
      room, I held out my hand over the table&mdash;to Chatellerault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Comte,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you are most choicely met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would have added more, but there was something in his attitude that
      silenced me. He had turned half from me, and stood now, hand on hip, his
      great head thrown back and tilted towards his shoulder, his expression one
      of freezing and disdainful wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if his attitude filled me with astonishment and apprehension,
      consider how these feelings were heightened by his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Lesperon, I can but express amazement at your effrontery. If
      we have been acquainted in the past, do you think that is a sufficient
      reason for me to take your hand now that you have placed yourself in a
      position which renders it impossible for His Majesty&rsquo;s loyal servants to
      know you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I fell back a pace, my mind scarce grasping yet the depths of this
      inexplicable attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This to me, Chatellerault?&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you?&rdquo; he blazed, stirred to a sudden passion. &ldquo;What else did you
      expect, Monsieur de Lesperon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had it in me to give him the lie, to denounce him then for a low,
      swindling trickster. I understood all at once the meaning of this wondrous
      make-believe. From Saint-Eustache he had gathered the mistake there was,
      and for his wager&rsquo;s sake he would let the error prevail, and hurry me to
      the scaffold. What else might I have expected from the man that had lured
      me into such a wager&mdash;a wager which the knowledge he possessed had
      made him certain of winning? Would he who had cheated at the dealing of
      the cards neglect an opportunity to cheat again during the progress of the
      game?
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, I had it in my mind to cry out that he lied&mdash;that I
      was not Lesperon; that he knew I was Bardelys. But the futility of such an
      outcry came to me simultaneously with the thought of it. And, I fear me, I
      stood before him and his satellites&mdash;the mocking Saint-Eustache
      amongst them&mdash;a very foolish figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no more to be said,&rdquo; I murmured at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;There is much more to be said. You shall
      render yet an account of your treason, and I am afraid, my poor rebel,
      that your comely head will part company with your shapely body. You and I
      will meet at Toulouse. What more is to be said will be said in the
      Tribunal there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chill encompassed me. I was doomed, it seemed. This man, ruling the
      province pending the King&rsquo;s arrival, would see to it that none came
      forward to recognize me. He would expedite the comedy of my trial, and
      close it with the tragedy of my execution. My professions of a mistake of
      identity&mdash;if I wasted breath upon them would be treated with disdain
      and disregarded utterly. God! What a position had I got myself into, and
      what a vein of comedy ran through it&mdash;grim, tragic comedy, if you
      will, yet comedy to all faith. The very woman whom I had wagered to wed
      had betrayed me into the hands of the very man with whom I laid my wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was more in it than that. As I had told Mironsac that night in
      Paris, when the thing had been initiated, it was a duel that was being
      fought betwixt Chatellerault and me&mdash;a duel for supremacy in the
      King&rsquo;s good graces. We were rivals, and he desired my removal from the
      Court. To this end had he lured me into a bargain that should result in my
      financial ruin, thereby compelling me to withdraw from the costly life of
      the Luxembourg, and leaving him supreme, the sole and uncontested
      recipient of our master&rsquo;s favour. Now into his hand Fate had thrust a
      stouter weapon and a deadlier: a weapon which not only should make him
      master of the wealth that I had pledged, but one whereby he might remove
      me for all time, a thousandfold more effectively than the mere
      encompassing of my ruin would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was doomed. I realized it fully and very bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was to go out of the ways of men unnoticed and unmourned; as a rebel,
      under the obscure name of another and bearing another&rsquo;s sins upon my
      shoulders, I was to pass almost unheeded to the gallows. Bardelys the
      Magnificent&mdash;the Marquis Marcel Saint-Pol de Bardelys, whose
      splendour had been a byword in France&mdash;was to go out like a guttering
      candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought filled me with the awful frenzy that so often goes with
      impotency, such a frenzy as the damned in hell may know. I forgot in that
      hour my precept that under no conditions should a gentleman give way to
      anger. In a blind access of fury I flung myself across the table and
      caught that villainous cheat by the throat, before any there could put out
      a hand to stop me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a heavy man, if a short one, and the strength of his thick-set
      frame was a thing abnormal. Yet at that moment such nervous power did I
      gather from my rage, that I swung him from his feet as though he had been
      the puniest weakling. I dragged him down on to the table, and there I
      ground his face with a most excellent good-will and relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liar, you cheat, you thief!&rdquo; I snarled like any cross-grained
      mongrel. &ldquo;The King shall hear of this, you knave! By God, he shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dragged me from him at last&mdash;those lapdogs that attended him&mdash;and
      with much rough handling they sent me sprawling among the sawdust on the
      floor. It is more than likely that but for Castelroux&rsquo;s intervention they
      had made short work of me there and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with a bunch of Mordieus, Sangdieus, and Po&rsquo; Cap de Dieus, the little
      Gascon flung himself before my prostrate figure, and bade them in the
      King&rsquo;s name, and at their peril, to stand back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chatellerault, sorely shaken, his face purple, and with blood streaming
      from his nostrils, had sunk into a chair. He rose now, and his first words
      were incoherent, raging gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, sir?&rdquo; he bellowed at last, addressing the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amedee de Mironsac de Castelroux, of Chateau Rouge in Gascony,&rdquo; answered
      my captor, with a grand manner and a flourish, and added, &ldquo;Your servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What authority have you to allow your prisoners this degree of freedom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not need authority, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Gascon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not?&rdquo; blazed the Count. &ldquo;We shall see. Wait until I am in
      Toulouse, my malapert friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Castelroux drew himself up, straight as a rapier, his face slightly
      flushed and his glance angry, yet he had the presence of mind to restrain
      himself, partly at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my orders from the Keeper of the Seals, to effect the apprehension
      of Monsieur de Lesperon; and to deliver him up, alive or dead, at
      Toulouse. So that I do this, the manner of it is my own affair, and who
      presumes to criticize my methods censoriously impugns my honour and
      affronts me. And who affronts me, monsieur, be he whosoever he may be,
      renders me satisfaction. I beg that you will bear that circumstance in
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His moustaches bristled as he spoke, and altogether his air was very
      fierce and truculent. For a moment I trembled for him. But the Count
      evidently thought better of it than to provoke a quarrel, particularly one
      in which he would be manifestly in the wrong, King&rsquo;s Commissioner though
      he might be. There was an exchange of questionable compliments betwixt the
      officer and the Count, whereafter, to avoid further unpleasantness,
      Castelroux conducted me to a private room, where we took our meal in
      gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until an hour later, when we were again in the saddle and upon
      the last stage of our journey, that I offered Castelroux an explanation of
      my seemingly mad attack upon Chatellerault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done a very rash and unwise thing, monsieur,&rdquo; he had commented
      regretfully, and it was in answer to this that I poured out the whole
      story. I had determined upon this course while we were supping, for
      Castelroux was now my only hope, and as we rode beneath the stars of that
      September night I made known to him my true identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that Chatellerault knew me, and I informed him that a wager lay
      between us&mdash;withholding the particulars of its nature&mdash;which had
      brought me into Languedoc and into the position wherein he had found and
      arrested me. At first he hesitated to believe me, but when at last I had
      convinced him by the vehemence of my assurances as much as by the
      assurances themselves, he expressed such opinions of the Comte de
      Chatellerault as made my heart go out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my dear Castelroux, that you are now my last hope,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A forlorn one, my poor gentleman!&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, that need not be. My intendant Rodenard and some twenty of my
      servants should be somewhere betwixt this and Paris. Let them be sought
      for monsieur, and let us pray God that they be still in Languedoc and may
      be found in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done, monsieur, I promise you,&rdquo; he answered me solemnly. &ldquo;But
      I implore you not to hope too much from it. Chatellerault has it in his
      power to act promptly, and you may depend that he will waste no time after
      what has passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, we may have two or three days, and in those days you must do what
      you can, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon me,&rdquo; he promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And meanwhile, Castelroux,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will say no word of this to any
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That assurance also he gave me, and presently the lights of our
      destination gleamed out to greet us.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night I lay in a dank and gloomy cell of the prison of Toulouse, with
      never a hope to bear company during those dark, wakeful hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull rage was in my soul as I thought of my position, for it had not
      needed Castelroux&rsquo;s recommendation to restrain me from building false
      hopes upon his chances of finding Rodenard and my followers in time to
      save me. Some little ray of consolation I culled, perhaps, from my
      thoughts of Roxalanne. Out of the gloom of my cell my fancy fashioned her
      sweet girl face and stamped it with a look of gentle pity, of infinite
      sorrow for me and for the hand she had had in bringing me to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she loved me I was assured, and I swore that if I lived I would win
      her yet, in spite of every obstacle that I myself had raised for my
      undoing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE TRIBUNAL OF TOULOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had hoped to lie some days in prison before being brought to trial, and
      that during those days Castelroux might have succeeded in discovering
      those who could witness to my identity. Conceive, therefore, something of
      my dismay when on the morrow I was summoned an hour before noon to go
      present myself to my judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the prison to the Palace I was taken in chains like any thief&mdash;for
      the law demanded this indignity to be borne by one charged with the crimes
      they imputed to me. The distance was but short, yet I found it over-long,
      which is not wonderful considering that the people stopped to line up as I
      went by and to cast upon me a shower of opprobrious derision&mdash;for
      Toulouse was a very faithful and loyal city. It was within some two
      hundred yards of the Palace steps that I suddenly beheld a face in the
      crowd, at the sight of which I stood still in my amazement. This earned me
      a stab in the back from the butt-end of the pike of one of my guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you now?&rdquo; quoth the man irritably. &ldquo;Forward, Monsieur le
      traite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I moved on, scarce remarking the fellow&rsquo;s roughness; my eyes were still
      upon that face&mdash;the white, piteous face of Roxalanne. I smiled
      reassurance and encouragement, but even as I smiled the horror in her
      countenance seemed to increase. Then, as I passed on, she vanished from my
      sight, and I was left to conjecture the motives that had occasioned her
      return to Toulouse. Had the message that Marsac would yesterday have
      conveyed to her caused her to retrace her steps that she might be near me
      in my extremity; or had some weightier reason influenced her return? Did
      she hope to undo some of the evil she had done? Alas, poor child! If such
      were her hopes, I sorely feared me they would prove very idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of my trial I should say but little did not the exigencies of my story
      render it necessary to say much. Even now, across the gap of years, my
      gorge rises at the mockery which, in the King&rsquo;s name, those gentlemen made
      of justice. I can allow for the troubled conditions of the times, and I
      can realize how in cases of civil disturbances and rebellion it may be
      expedient to deal summarily with traitors, yet not all the allowances that
      I can think of would suffice to condone the methods of that tribunal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial was conducted in private by the Keeper of the Seals&mdash;a
      lean, wizened individual, with an air as musty and dry as that of the
      parchments among which he had spent his days. He was supported by six
      judges, and on his right sat the King&rsquo;s Commissioner, Monsieur de
      Chatellerault&mdash;the bruised condition of whose countenance still
      advertised the fact that we had met but yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon being asked my name and place of abode, I created some commotion by
      answering boldly &ldquo;I am the Sieur Marcel de Saint-Pol, Marquis of Bardelys,
      of Bardelys in Picardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President&mdash;that is to say, the Keeper of the Seals&mdash;turned
      inquiringly to Chatellerault. The Count, however, did no more than smile
      and point to something written on a paper that lay spread upon the table.
      The President nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Rene de Lesperon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Court may perhaps not be able
      to discriminate whether this statement of yours is a deliberate attempt to
      misguide or frustrate the ends of justice, or whether, either in
      consequence of your wounds or as a visitation of God for your treason, you
      are the victim of a deplorable hallucination. But the Court wishes you to
      understand that it is satisfied of your identity. The papers found upon
      your person at the time of your arrest, besides other evidence in our
      power, remove all possibility of doubt in that connection. Therefore, in
      your own interests, we implore you to abandon these false statements, if
      so be that you are master of your wits. Your only hope of saving your head
      must lie in your truthfully answering our questions, and even then,
      Monsieur de Lesperon, the hope that we hold out to you is so slight as to
      be no hope at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, during which the other judges nodded their heads in
      sage approval of their President&rsquo;s words. For myself, I kept silent,
      perceiving how little it could avail me to continue to protest, and
      awaited his next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were arrested, monsieur, at the Chateau de Lavedan two nights ago by
      a company of dragoons under the command of Captain de Castelroux. Is that
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at the time of your arrest, upon being apprehended as Rene de
      Lesperon, you offered no repudiation of the identity; on the contrary,
      when Monsieur de Castelroux called for Monsieur de Lesperon, you stepped
      forward and acknowledged that you were he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, monsieur. What I acknowledged was that I was known by that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President chuckled evilly, and his satellites smiled in polite
      reflection of his mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This acute differentiating is peculiar, Monsieur de Lesperon, to persons
      of unsound mental condition,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am afraid that it will serve
      little purpose. A man is generally known by his name, is he not?&rdquo; I did
      not answer him. &ldquo;Shall we call Monsieur de Castelroux to confirm what I
      have said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary. Since you allow that I may have said I was known by
      the name, but refuse to recognize the distinction between that and a
      statement that &lsquo;Lesperon&rsquo; is my name, it would serve no purpose to summon
      the Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President nodded, and with that the point was dismissed, and he
      proceeded as calmly as though there never had been any question of my
      identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are charged, Monsieur de Lesperon, with high treason in its most
      virulent and malignant form. You are accused of having borne arms against
      His Majesty. Have you anything to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to say that it is false, monsieur; that His Majesty has no more
      faithful or loving subject than am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President shrugged his shoulders, and a shade of annoyance crossed his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are come here for no other purpose than to deny the statements
      that I make, I am afraid that we are but wasting time,&rdquo; he cried testily.
      &ldquo;If you desire it, I can summon Monsieur de Castelroux to swear that at
      the time of your arrest and upon being charged with the crime you made no
      repudiation of that charge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally not, monsieur,&rdquo; I cried, somewhat heated by this seemingly
      studied ignoring of important facts, &ldquo;because I realized that it was
      Monsieur de Castelroux&rsquo;s mission to arrest and not to judge me. Monsieur
      de Castelroux was an officer, not a Tribunal, and to have denied this or
      that to him would have been so much waste of breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Very nimble; very nimble, in truth, Monsieur de Lesperon, but
      scarcely convincing. We will proceed. You are charged with having taken
      part in several of the skirmishes against the armies of Marshals de
      Schomberg and La Force, and finally, with having been in close attendance
      upon Monsieur de Montmorency at the battle of Castelnaudary. What have you
      to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it is utterly untrue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet your name, monsieur, is on a list found among the papers in the
      captured baggage of Monsieur le Duc de Montmorency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; I denied stoutly, &ldquo;it is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President smote the table a blow that scattered a flight of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Par la mort Dieu!&rdquo; he roared, with a most indecent exhibition of temper
      in one so placed. &ldquo;I have had enough of your contradictions. You forget,
      monsieur, your position&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; I broke in harshly, &ldquo;no less than you forget yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Keeper of the Seals gasped for breath at that, and his fellow judges
      murmured angrily amongst themselves. Chatellerault maintained his sardonic
      smile, but permitted himself to utter no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, gentlemen,&rdquo; I cried, addressing them all, &ldquo;that His Majesty were
      here to see how you conduct your trials and defile his Courts. As for you,
      Monsieur le President, you violate the sanctity of your office in giving
      way to anger; it is a thing unpardonable in a judge. I have told you in
      plain terms, gentlemen, that I am not this Rene de Lesperon with whose
      crimes you charge me. Yet, in spite of my denials, ignoring them, or
      setting them down either to a futile attempt at defence or to an
      hallucination of which you suppose me the victim, you proceed to lay those
      crimes to my charge, and when I deny your charges you speak of proofs that
      can only apply to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall the name of Lesperon having been found among the Duke of
      Montmorency&rsquo;s papers convict me of treason, since I tell you that I am not
      Lesperon? Had you the slightest, the remotest sense of your high duty,
      messieurs, you would ask me rather to explain how, if what I state be
      true, I come to be confounded with Lesperon and arrested in his place.
      Then, messieurs, you might seek to test the accuracy of what statements I
      may make; but to proceed as you are proceeding is not to judge but to
      murder. Justice is represented as a virtuous woman with bandaged eyes,
      holding impartial scales; in your hands, gentlemen, by my soul, she is
      become a very harlot clutching a veil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatellerault&rsquo;s cynical smile grew broader as my speech proceeded and
      stirred up the rancour in the hearts of those august gentlemen. The Keeper
      of the Seals went white and red by turns, and when I paused there was an
      impressive silence that lasted for some moments. At last the President
      leant over to confer in a whisper with Chatellerault. Then, in a voice
      forcedly calm&mdash;like the calm of Nature when thunder is brewing&mdash;he
      asked me, &ldquo;Who do you insist that you are, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once already have I told you, and I venture to think that mine is a name
      not easily forgotten. I am the Sieur Marcel de Saint-Pol, Marquis of
      Bardelys, of Bardelys in Picardy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cunning grin parted his thin lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any witnesses to identify you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds, monsieur!&rdquo; I answered eagerly, seeing salvation already within
      my grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will name one&mdash;one whose word you will not dare to doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty the King. I am told that he is on his way to Toulouse, and I
      but ask, messieurs, that you await his arrival before going further with
      my trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no other witness of whom you can think, monsieur? Some witness
      that might be produced more readily. For if you can, indeed, establish the
      identity you claim, why should you languish in prison for some weeks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was soft and oily. The anger had all departed out of it, which I&mdash;like
      a fool&mdash;imagined to be due to my mention of the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, Monsieur le Garde des Sceaux, are all either in Paris or in
      His Majesty&rsquo;s train, and so not likely to be here before him. There is my
      intendant, Rodenard, and there are my servants&mdash;some twenty of them&mdash;who
      may perhaps be still in Languedoc, and for whom I would entreat you to
      seek. Them you might succeed in finding within a few days if they have not
      yet determined to return to Paris in the belief that I am dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stroked his chin meditatively, his eyes raised to the sunlit dome of
      glass overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; he gasped. It was a long-drawn sigh of regret, of conclusion, or
      of weary impatience. &ldquo;There is no one in Toulouse who will swear to your
      identity monsieur?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid there is not,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I know of no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I uttered those words the President&rsquo;s countenance changed as abruptly
      as if he had flung off a mask. From soft and cat-like that he had been
      during the past few moments, he grew of a sudden savage as a tiger. He
      leapt to his feet, his face crimson, his eyes seeming to blaze, and the
      words he spoke came now in a hot, confused, and almost incoherent torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable!&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;out of your own mouth have you convicted
      yourself. And to think that you should have stood there and wasted the
      time of this Court&mdash;His Majesty&rsquo;s time&mdash;with your damnable
      falsehoods! What purpose did you think to serve by delaying your doom? Did
      you imagine that haply, whilst we sent to Paris for your witnesses, the
      King might grow weary of justice, and in some fit of clemency announce a
      general pardon? Such things have been known, and it may be that in your
      cunning you played for such a gain based upon such a hope. But justice,
      fool, is not to be cozened. Had you, indeed, been Bardelys, you had seen
      that here in this court sits a gentleman who is very intimate with him. He
      is there, monsieur; that is Monsieur le Comte de Chatellerault, of whom
      perhaps you may have heard. Yet, when I ask you whether in Toulouse there
      is any one who can bear witness to your identity, you answer me that you
      know of no one. I will waste no more time with you, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself back into his chair like a man exhausted, and mopped his
      brow with a great kerchief which he had drawn from his robes. His fellow
      judges laid their heads together, and with smiles and nods, winks and
      leers, they discussed and admired the miraculous subtlety and acumen of
      this Solomon. Chatellerault sat, calmly smiling, in solemn mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a spell I was too thunderstruck to speak, aghast at this catastrophe.
      Like a fool, indeed, I had tumbled into the pit that had been dug for me
      by Chatellerault for I never doubted that it was of his contriving. At
      last, &ldquo;My masters,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;these conclusions may appear to you most
      plausible, but, believe me, they are fallacious. I am perfectly acquainted
      with Monsieur de Chatellerault, and he with me, and if he were to speak
      the truth and play the man and the gentleman for once, he would tell you
      that I am, indeed, Bardelys. But Monsieur le Comte has ends of his own to
      serve in sending me to my doom. It is in a sense through his agency that I
      am at present in this position, and that I have been confounded with
      Lesperon. What, then, could it have availed me to have made appeal to him?
      And yet, Monsieur le President, he was born a gentleman, and he may still
      retain some notion of honour. Ask him, sir&mdash;ask him point-blank,
      whether I am or not Marcel de Bardelys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The firmness of my tones created some impression upon those feeble minds.
      Indeed, the President went so far as to turn an interrogative glance upon
      the Count. But Chatellerault, supremely master of the situation, shrugged
      his shoulders, and smiled a pitying, long-suffering smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I really answer such a question, Monsieur le President?&rdquo; he inquired
      in a voice and with a manner that clearly implied how low would be his
      estimate of the President&rsquo;s intelligence if he were, indeed, constrained
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; replied the President with sudden haste, and
      in scornful rejection of the idea. &ldquo;There is no necessity that you should
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the question, Monsieur le President!&rdquo; I thundered, my hand
      outstretched towards Chatellerault. &ldquo;Ask him&mdash;if you have any sense
      of your duty&mdash;ask him am I not Marcel de Bardelys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; blazed the President back at me. &ldquo;You shall not fool us any
      longer, you nimble-witted liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My head drooped. This coward had, indeed, shattered my last hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, monsieur,&rdquo; I said very quietly, &ldquo;I promise you that your
      behaviour and these gratuitous insults shall cost you your position. Pray
      God they do not cost you also your head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My words they treated as one might treat the threats of a child. That I
      should have had the temerity to utter them did but serve finally to decide
      my doom, if, indeed, anything had been wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With many epithets of opprobrium, such as are applied to malefactors of
      the lowest degree, they passed sentence of death upon me, and with
      drooping spirits, giving myself up for lost and assured that I should be
      led to the block before many hours were sped, I permitted them to
      reconduct me through the streets of Toulouse to my prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could entertain you at length upon my sensations as I walked between my
      guards, a man on the threshold of eternity, with hundreds of men and women
      gaping at me&mdash;men and women who would live for years to gape upon
      many another wretch in my position. The sun shone with a brilliance that
      to such eyes as mine was a very mockery. Thus would it shine on through
      centuries, and light many another unfortunate to the scaffold. The very
      sky seemed pitiless in the intensity of its cobalt. Unfeeling I deemed the
      note that everywhere was struck by man and Nature, so discordant was it
      with my gloomy outlook. If you would have food for reflection upon the
      evanescent quality of life, upon the nothingness of man, upon the empty,
      heartless egoism implicit in human nature, get yourselves sentenced to
      death, and then look around you. With such a force was all this borne in
      upon me, and with such sufficiency, that after the first pang was spent I
      went near to rejoicing that things were as they were, and that I was to
      die, haply before sunset. It was become such a world as did not seem worth
      a man&rsquo;s while to live in: a world of vainness, of hollowness, of meanness,
      of nothing but illusions. The knowledge that I was about to die, that I
      was about to quit all this, seemed to have torn some veil from my eyes,
      and to have permitted me to recognize the worthless quality of what I
      left. Well may it be that such are but the thoughts of a man&rsquo;s dying
      moments, whispered into his soul by a merciful God to predispose him for
      the wrench and agony of his passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been a half-hour in my cell when the door was opened to admit
      Castelroux, whom I had not seen since the night before. He came to condole
      with me in my extremity, and yet to bid me not utterly lose hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late to-day to carry out the sentence,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and as
      to-morrow will be Sunday, you will have until the day after. By then much
      may betide, monsieur. My agents are everywhere scouring the province for
      your servants, and let us pray Heaven that they may succeed in their
      search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a forlorn hope, Monsieur de Castelroux,&rdquo; I sighed, &ldquo;and I will pin
      no faith to it lest I suffer a disappointment that will embitter my last
      moments, and perhaps rob me of some of the fortitude I shall have need
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered me, nevertheless, with words of encouragement. No effort was
      being spared, and if Rodenard and my men were still in Languedoc then was
      every likelihood that they would be brought to Toulouse in time. Then he
      added that that, however, was not the sole object of his visit. A lady had
      obtained permission of the Keeper of the Seals to visit me, and she was
      waiting to be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady?&rdquo; I exclaimed, and the thought of Roxalanne flitted through my
      mind. &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Lavedan?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he; then added, &ldquo;She seems in sore affliction,
      monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I besought him to admit her forthwith, and presently she came. Castelroux
      closed the door as he withdrew, and we were left alone together. As she
      put aside her cloak, and disclosed to me the pallor of her face and the
      disfiguring red about her gentle eyes, telling of tears and sleeplessness,
      all my own trouble seemed to vanish in the contemplation of her
      affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood a moment confronting each other with no word spoken. Then,
      dropping her glance, and advancing a step, in a faltering, hesitating
      manner &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur,&rdquo; she murmured in a suffocating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a bound I was beside her, and I had gathered her in my arms, her little
      brown head against my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne!&rdquo; I whispered as soothingly as I might&mdash;&ldquo;Roxalanne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she struggled to be free of my embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, monsieur,&rdquo; she pleaded, a curious shrinking in her very voice.
      &ldquo;Do not touch me, monsieur. You do not know&mdash;you do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, I enfolded her more tightly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do know, little one,&rdquo; I whispered; &ldquo;and I even understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that, her struggles ceased upon the instant, and she seemed to lie limp
      and helpless in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, monsieur,&rdquo; she questioned me&mdash;&ldquo;you know that I betrayed
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can forgive me? I am sending you to your death and you have no
      reproaches for me! Oh, monsieur, it will kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, child!&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;What reproaches can I have for you? I know
      the motives that impelled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether, monsieur; you cannot know them. I loved you, monsieur. I
      do love you, monsieur. Oh! this is not a time to consider words. If I am
      bold and unmaidenly, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither bold nor unmaidenly, but&mdash;oh, the sweetest damsel in all
      France, my Roxalanne!&rdquo; I broke in, coming to her aid. &ldquo;Mine was a leprous,
      sinful soul, child, when I came into Languedoc. I had no faith in any
      human good, and I looked as little for an honest man or a virtuous woman
      as one looks for honey in a nettle. I was soured, and my life had hardly
      been such a life as it was meet to bring into contact with your own. Then,
      among the roses at Lavedan, in your dear company, Roxalanne, it seemed
      that some of the good, some of the sweetness, some of the purity about you
      were infused anew into my heart. I became young again, and I seemed oddly
      cleansed. In that hour of my rejuvenation I loved you, Roxalanne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face had been raised to mine as I spoke. There came now a flutter of
      the eyelids, a curious smile about the lips. Then her head drooped again
      and was laid against my breast; a sigh escaped her, and she began to weep
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Roxalanne, do not fret. Come, child, it is not your way to be weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have betrayed you!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I am sending you to your death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, I understand,&rdquo; I answered, smoothing her brown hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite, monsieur. I loved you so, monsieur, that you can have no
      thought of how I suffered that morning when Mademoiselle de Marsac came to
      Lavedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first it was but the pain of thinking that&mdash;that I was about to
      lose you; that you were to go out of my life, and that I should see you no
      more&mdash;you whom I had enshrined so in my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called myself a little fool that morning for having dreamed that you
      had come to care for me; my vanity I thought had deluded me into imagining
      that your manner towards me had a tenderness that spoke of affection. I
      was bitter with myself, and I suffered oh, so much! Then later, when I was
      in the rose garden, you came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember how you seized me, and how by your manner you showed me that
      it was not vanity alone had misled me. You had fooled me, I thought; even
      in that hour I imagined you were fooling me; you made light of me; and my
      sufferings were naught to you so that I might give you some amusement to
      pass the leisure and monotony of your sojourn with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne&mdash;my poor Roxalanne!&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my bitterness and sorrow all turned to anger against you. You had
      broken my heart, and I thought that you had done it wantonly. For that I
      burned to punish you. Ah! and not only that, perhaps. I think, too, that
      some jealousy drove me on. You had wooed and slighted me, yet you had made
      me love you, and if you were not for me I swore you should be for no
      other. And so, while my madness endured, I quitted Lavedan, and telling my
      father that I was going to Auch, to his sister&rsquo;s house, I came to Toulouse
      and betrayed you to the Keeper of the Seals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarce was the thing done than I beheld the horror of it, and I hated
      myself. In my despair, I abandoned all idea of pursuing the journey to
      Auch, but turned and made my way back in haste, hoping that I might still
      come to warn you. But at Grenade I met you already in charge of the
      soldiers. At Grenade, too I learnt the truth&mdash;that you were not
      Lesperon. Can you not guess something of my anguish then? Already loathing
      my act, and beside myself for having betrayed you, think into what despair
      I was plunged by Monsieur de Marsac&rsquo;s intimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I understood that for reasons of your own you had concealed your
      identity. You were not perhaps, betrothed; indeed, I remembered then how,
      solemnly you had sworn that you were not; and so I bethought me that your
      vows to me may have been sincere and such as a maid might honourably
      listen to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were, Roxalanne! they were!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she continued &ldquo;That you had Mademoiselle de Marsac&rsquo;s portrait was
      something that I could not explain; but then I hear that you had also
      Lesperon&rsquo;s papers upon you; so that you may have become possessed of the
      one with the others. And now, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and there against my breast she lay weeping and weeping in her
      bitter passion of regret, until it seemed to me she would never regain her
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been all my fault, Roxalanne,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and if I am to pay the
      price they are exacting, it will be none too high. I embarked upon a
      dastardly business; which brought me to Languedoc under false colours. I
      wish, indeed, that I had told you when first the impulse to tell you came
      upon me. Afterwards it grew impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me now,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Tell me who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sorely was I tempted to respond. Almost was I on the point of doing so,
      when suddenly the thought of how she might shrink from me, of how, even
      then, she might come to think that I had but simulated love for her for
      infamous purposes of gain, restrained and silenced me. During the few
      hours of life that might be left me I would at least be lord and master of
      her heart. When I was dead&mdash;for I had little hope of Castelroux&rsquo;s
      efforts&mdash;it would matter less, and perhaps because I was dead she
      would be merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, Roxalanne. Not even now. It is too vile! If&mdash;if they carry
      out the sentence on Monday, I shall leave a letter for you, telling you
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered, and a sob escaped her. From my identity her mind fled back
      to the more important matter of my fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will not carry it out, monsieur! Oh, they till not! Say that you can
      defend yourself, that you are not the man they believe you to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are in God&rsquo;s hands, child. It may be that I shall save myself yet. If
      I do, I shall come straight to you, and you shall know all that there is
      to know. But, remember, child&rdquo;&mdash;and raising her face in my hands, I
      looked down into the blue of her tearful eyes&mdash;&ldquo;remember, little one,
      that in one thing I have been true and honourable, and influenced by
      nothing but my heart&mdash;in my wooing of you. I love you, Roxalanne,
      with all my soul, and if I should die you are the only thing in all this
      world that I experience a regret at leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe it; I do, indeed. Nothing can ever alter my belief again.
      Will you not, then, tell me who you are, and what is this thing, which you
      call dishonourable, that brought you into Languedoc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment again I pondered. Then I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, child,&rdquo; said I; and she, obedient to my wishes, asked no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the second time that I neglected a favourable opportunity of making
      that confession, and as I had regretted having allowed the first occasion
      to pass unprofited, so was I, and still more poignantly, to regret this
      second silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while she stayed with me yet, and I sought to instil some measure
      of comfort into her soul. I spoke of the hopes that I based upon
      Castelroux&rsquo;s finding friends to recognize me&mdash;hopes that were passing
      slender. And she, poor child, sought also to cheer me and give me courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only the King were here!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I would go to him, and on my
      knees I would plead for your enlargement. But they say he is no nearer
      than Lyons; and I could not hope to get there and back by Monday. I will
      go to the Keeper of the Seals again, monsieur, and I will beg him to be
      merciful, and at least to delay the sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not discourage her; I did not speak of the futility of such a step.
      But I begged her to remain in Toulouse until Monday, that she might visit
      me again before the end, if the end were to become inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Castelroux came to reconduct her, and we parted. But she left me a
      great consolation, a great strengthening comfort. If I were destined,
      indeed, to walk to the scaffold, it seemed that I could do it with a
      better grace and a gladder courage now.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE ELEVENTH HOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Castelroux visited me upon the following morning, but he brought no news
      that might be accounted encouraging. None of his messengers were yet
      returned, nor had any sent word that they were upon the trail of my
      followers. My heart sank a little, and such hope as I still fostered was
      fast perishing. Indeed, so imminent did my doom appear and so unavoidable,
      that later in the day I asked for pen and paper that I might make an
      attempt at setting my earthly affairs to rights. Yet when the writing
      materials were brought me, I wrote not. I sat instead with the feathered
      end of my quill between my teeth, and thus pondered the matter of the
      disposal of my Picardy estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coldly I weighed the wording of the wager and the events that had
      transpired, and I came at length to the conclusion that Chatellerault
      could not be held to have the least claim upon my lands. That he had
      cheated at the very outset, as I have earlier shown, was of less account
      than that he had been instrumental in violently hindering me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took at last the resolve to indite a full memoir of the transaction, and
      to request Castelroux to see that it was delivered to the King himself.
      Thus not only would justice be done, but I should&mdash;though tardily&mdash;be
      even with the Count. No doubt he relied upon his power to make a thorough
      search for such papers as I might leave, and to destroy everything that
      might afford indication of my true identity. But he had not counted upon
      the good feeling that had sprung up betwixt the little Gascon captain and
      me, nor yet upon my having contrived to convince the latter that I was,
      indeed, Bardelys, and he little dreamt of such a step as I was about to
      take to ensure his punishment hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved at last, I was commencing to write when my attention was arrested
      by an unusual sound. It was at first no more than a murmuring noise, as of
      at sea breaking upon its shore. Gradually it grew its volume and assumed
      the shape of human voices raised in lusty clamour. Then, above the din of
      the populace, a gun boomed out, then another, and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sprang up at that, and, wondering what might be toward, I crossed to my
      barred window and stood there listening. I overlooked the courtyard of the
      jail, and I could see some commotion below, in sympathy, as it were, with
      the greater commotion without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, as the populace drew nearer, it seemed to me that the shouting
      was of acclamation. Next I caught a blare of trumpets, and, lastly, I was
      able to distinguish above the noise, which had now grown to monstrous
      proportions, the clattering hoofs of some cavalcade that was riding past
      the prison doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was borne in upon me that some great personage was arriving in
      Toulouse, and my first thought was of the King. At the idea of such a
      possibility my brain whirled and I grew dizzy with hope. The next moment I
      recalled that but last night Roxalanne had told me that he was no nearer
      than Lyons, and so I put the thought from me, and the hope with it, for,
      travelling in that leisurely, indolent fashion that was characteristic of
      his every action, it would be a miracle if His Majesty should reach
      Toulouse before the week was out, and this but Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The populace passed on, then seemed to halt, and at last the shouts died
      down on the noontide air. I went back to my writing, and to wait until
      from my jailer, when next he should chance to appear, I might learn the
      meaning of that uproar.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour perhaps went by, and I had made some progress with my memoir, when
      my door was opened and the cheery voice of Castelroux greeted me from the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I have brought a friend to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned in my chair, and one glance at the gentle, comely face and the
      fair hair of the young man standing beside Castelroux was enough to bring
      me of a sudden to my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mironsac!&rdquo; I shouted, and sprang towards him with hands outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though my joy was great and my surprise profound, greater still was
      the bewilderment that in Mironsac&rsquo;s face I saw depicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Bardelys!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and a hundred questions were
      contained in his astonished eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po&rsquo; Cap de Dieu!&rdquo; growled his cousin, &ldquo;I was well advised, it seems, to
      have brought you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Mironsac asked his cousin, as he took my hands in his own, &ldquo;why did
      you not tell me, Amedee, that it was to Monsieur le Marquis de Bardelys
      that you were conducting me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have had me spoil so pleasant a surprise?&rdquo; his cousin demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Armand,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;never was a man more welcome than are you. You are but
      come in time to save my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, in answer to his questions, I told him briefly of all that had
      befallen me since that night in Paris when the wager had been laid, and of
      how, through the cunning silence of Chatellerault, I was now upon the very
      threshold of the scaffold. His wrath burst forth at that, and what he said
      of the Count did me good to hear. At last I stemmed his invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that be for the present, Mironsac,&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;You are here, and you
      can thwart all Chatellerault&rsquo;s designs by witnessing to my identity before
      the Keeper of the Seals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then of a sudden a doubt closed like a cold hand upon my brain. I
      turned to Castelroux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;What if they were to deny me a fresh trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deny it you!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;They will not be asked to grant you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no need,&rdquo; added Mironsac. &ldquo;I have but to tell the King&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my friend,&rdquo; I exclaimed impatiently, &ldquo;I am to die in the morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the King shall be told to-day&mdash;now, at once. I will go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared askance a moment; then the thought of the uproar that I had heard
      recurring to me, &ldquo;Has the King arrived already?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, monsieur. How else do I come to be here? I am in His Majesty&rsquo;s
      train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that I grew again impatient. I thought of Roxalanne and of how she must
      be suffering, and I bethought me that every moment Mironsac now remained
      in my cell was another moment of torture for that poor child. So I urged
      him to be gone at once and carry news of my confinement to His Majesty. He
      obeyed me, and I was left alone once more, to pace up and down in my
      narrow cell, a prey to an excitement such as I should have thought I had
      outlived.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a half-hour Castelroux returned alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I cried the moment the door opened, and without giving him so much
      as time to enter. &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mironsac tells me that His Majesty is more overwrought than he has ever
      seen him. You are to come to the Palace at once. I have an order here from
      the King.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went in a coach, and with all privacy, for he informed me that His
      Majesty desired the affair to be kept secret, having ends of his own to
      serve thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was left to wait some moments in an ante-chamber, whilst Castelroux
      announced me to the King; then I was ushered into a small apartment,
      furnished very sumptuously in crimson and gold, and evidently set apart
      for His Majesty&rsquo;s studies or devotions. As I entered, Louis&rsquo;s back was
      towards me. He was standing&mdash;a tall, spare figure in black&mdash;leaning
      against the frame of a window, his head supported on his raised left arm
      and his eyes intent upon the gardens below.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained so until Castelroux had withdrawn and the door had closed
      again; then, turning suddenly, he confronted me, his back to the light, so
      that his face was in a shadow that heightened its gloom and wonted
      weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voila, Monsieur de Bardelys!&rdquo; was his greeting, and unfriendly. &ldquo;See the
      pass to which your disobedience of my commands has brought you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would submit, Sire,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;that I have been brought to it by the
      incompetence of Your Majesty&rsquo;s judges and the ill-will of others whom Your
      Majesty honours with too great a confidence, rather than by this same
      disobedience of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one and the other, perhaps,&rdquo; he said more softly. &ldquo;Though, after all,
      they appear to have had a very keen nose for a traitor. Come, Bardelys,
      confess yourself that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? A traitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders, and laughed without any conspicuous mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not a traitor one who runs counter to the wishes; of his King? And are
      you not, therefore, a traitor, whether they call you Lesperon or Bardelys?
      But there,&rdquo; he ended more softly still, and flinging himself into a chair
      as he spoke, &ldquo;I have been so wearied since you left me, Marcel. They have
      the best intentions in the world, these dullards, and some of them love me
      even; but they are tiresome all. Even Chatellerault, when he has a fancy
      for a jest&mdash;as in your case perpetrates it with the grace of a bear,
      the sprightliness of an elephant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find it no jest, Marcel? Pardieu, who shall blame you? He would be a
      man of unhealthy humour that could relish such a pleasantry as that of
      being sentenced to death. But tell me of it. The whole story, Marcel. I
      have not heard a story worth the listening to since&mdash;since you left
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it please you, Sire, to send for the Comte de Chatellerault ere I
      begin?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatellerault? No, no.&rdquo; He shook his head whimsically. &ldquo;Chatellerault has
      had his laugh already, and, like the ill-mannered dog he is, he has kept
      it to himself. I think, Marcel, that it is our turn now. I have purposely
      sent Chatellerault away that he may gain no notion of the catastrophic
      jest we are preparing him in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words set me in the very best of humours, and to that it may be due
      that presently, as I warmed to my narrative, I lent it a vigour that drew
      His Majesty out of his wonted apathy and listlessness. He leaned forward
      when I told him of my encounter with the dragoons at Mirepoix, and how
      first I had committed the false step of representing myself to be
      Lesperon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraged by his interest, I proceeded, and I told my story with as much
      piquancy as I was master of, repressing only those slight matters which
      might reflect upon Monsieur de Lavedan&rsquo;s loyalty, but otherwise dealing
      frankly with His Majesty, even down to the genuineness of the feelings I
      entertained for Roxalanne. Often he laughed, more often still he nodded
      approvingly, in understanding and sympathy, whilst now and then he purred
      his applause. But towards the end, when I came to the matter of the
      Tribunal of Toulouse, of how my trial was conducted, and of the part
      played in it by Chatellerault, his face grew set and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true&mdash;all this that you tell me?&rdquo; he cried harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as the Gospels. If you deem an oath necessary, Sire, I swear by
      my honour that I have uttered nothing that is false, and that, in
      connection with Monsieur de Chatellerault, even as I have suppressed
      nothing, so also have I exaggerated nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dastard!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;But we will avenge you, Marcel. Never fear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the trend of his thoughts being changed, he smiled wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith, you may thank God every night of your worthless life that I
      came so opportunely to Toulouse, and so may that fair child whose beauty
      you have limned with such a lover&rsquo;s ardour. Nay, never redden, Marcel.
      What? At your age, and with such a heavy score of affaires to your credit,
      has it been left for a simple Languedoc maiden to call a blush to your
      callous cheek? Ma foi, they say truly that love is a great regenerator, a
      great rejuvenator!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made him no answer other than a sigh, for his words set me thinking, and
      with thought came a tempering of the gay humour that had pervaded me.
      Remarking this, and misreading it, he laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Marcel, never fear. We will not be rigorous. You have won both the
      maid and the wager, and, by the Mass, you shall enjoy both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helas, Sire,&rdquo; I sighed again, &ldquo;when the lady comes to know of the wager&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waste no time in telling her, Marcel, and cast yourself upon her mercy.
      Nay, go not with so gloomy a face, my friend. When woman loves, she can be
      very merciful; leastways, they tell me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, his thoughts shifting ground once more, he grew stern again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first we have Chatellerault to deal with. What shall we do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for Your Majesty to decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me?&rdquo; he cried, his voice resuming the harshness that was never far
      from it. &ldquo;I have a fancy for having gentlemen about me. Think you I will
      set eyes again upon that dastard? I am already resolved concerning him,
      but it entered my mind that it might please you to be the instrument of
      the law for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, Sire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and why not? They say you can play a very deadly sword upon
      necessity. This is an occasion that demands an exception from our edict.
      You have my sanction to send the Comte de Chatellerault a challenge. And
      see that you kill him, Bardelys!&rdquo; he continued viciously. &ldquo;For, by the
      Mass, if you don&rsquo;t, I will! If he escapes your sword, or if he survives
      such hurt as you may do him, the headsman shall have him. Mordieu! is it
      for nothing that I am called Louis the Just?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood in thought for a moment. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I do this thing, Sire,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;the world will say of me that I
      did so to escape the payment I had incurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool, you have not incurred it. When a man cheats, does he not forfeit
      all his rights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true. But the world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peste!&rdquo; he snapped impatiently, &ldquo;you are beginning to weary me, Marcel&mdash;and
      all the world does that so excellently that it needs not your
      collaboration. Go your ways, man, and do as you elect. But take my
      sanction to slay this fellow Chatellerault, and I shall be the better
      pleased if you avail yourself of it. He is lodged at the Auberge Royale,
      where probably you will find him at present. Now, go. I have more justice
      to dispense in this rebellious province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I not resume my duties near Your Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered a moment, then he smiled in his weary way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would please me to have you, for these creatures are so dismally dull,
      all of them. Je m&rsquo;ennuie tellement, Marcel!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Ough! But, no, my
      friend, I do not doubt you would be as dull as any of them at present. A
      man in love is the weariest and most futile thing in all this weary,
      futile world. What shall I do with your body what time your soul is at
      Lavedan? I doubt me you are in haste to get you there. So go, Marcel. Get
      you wed, and live out your amorous intoxication; marriage is the best
      antidote. When that is done, return to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be never, Sire,&rdquo; I answered slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you so, Master Cupid Bardelys?&rdquo; And he combed his beard reflectively.
      &ldquo;Be not too sure. There have been other passions&mdash;aye, as great as
      yours&mdash;yet have they staled. But you waste my time. Go, Marcel; you
      are excused your duties by me for as long as your own affairs shall hold
      you elsewhere&mdash;for as long as you please. We are here upon a gloomy
      business&mdash;as you know. There are my cousin Montmorency and the others
      to be dealt with, and we are holding no levees, countenancing no revels.
      But come to me when you will, and I will see you. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I murmured my thanks, and very deep and sincere were they. Then, having
      kissed his hand, I left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XIII is a man who lacks not maligners. Of how history may come to
      speak of him it is not mine to hazard. But this I can say, that I, at
      least, did never find him other than a just and kindly master, an upright
      gentleman, capricious at times and wilful, as must inevitably be the case
      with such spoilt children of fortune as are princes, but of lofty ideals
      and high principles. It was his worst fault that he was always tired, and
      through that everlasting weariness he came to entrust the determining of
      most affairs to His Eminence. Hence has it resulted that the censure for
      many questionable acts of his reign, which were the work of my Lord
      Cardinal, has recoiled upon my august master&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to me, with all the faults that may be assigned him, he was ever Louis
      the Just, and wherever his name be mentioned in my hearing, I bare my
      head.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. EAVESDROPPING
    </h2>
    <p>
      I turned it over in my mind, after I had left the King&rsquo;s presence, whether
      or not I should visit with my own hands upon Chatellerault the punishment
      he had so fully earned. That I would have gone about the task rejoicing
      you may readily imagine; but there was that accursed wager, and&mdash;to
      restrain me&mdash;the thought of how such an action might be construed
      into an evasion of its consequences. Better a thousand times that His
      Majesty should order his arrest and deal with him for his attempted
      perversion of justice to the service of his own vile ends. The charge of
      having abused his trust as King&rsquo;s commissioner to the extent of seeking to
      do murder through the channels of the Tribunal was one that could not fail
      to have fatal results for him&mdash;as, indeed, the King had sworn.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the position of affairs as it concerned Chatellerault, the world,
      and me. But the position must also be considered as it concerned
      Roxalanne, and deeply, indeed, did I so consider it. Much pondering
      brought me again to the conclusion that until I had made the only
      atonement in my power, the only atonement that would leave me with clean
      hands, I must not again approach her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Chatellerault had cheated or not could not affect the question as
      it concerned Mademoiselle and me. If I paid the wager&mdash;whether in
      honour bound to do so or not&mdash;I might then go to her, impoverished,
      it is true, but at least with no suspicion attaching to my suit of any
      ulterior object other than that of winning Roxalanne herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could then make confession, and surely the fact that I had paid where
      clearly there was no longer any need to pay must earn me forgiveness and
      afford proof of the sincerity of my passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon such a course, then, did I decide, and, with this end in view, I took
      my way towards the Auberge Royale, where His Majesty had told me that the
      Count was lodged. It was my purpose to show myself fully aware of the
      treacherous and unworthy part he had played at the very inception of the
      affair, and that if I chose to consider the wager lost it was that I might
      the more honestly win the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon inquiring at the hostelry for Monsieur de Chatellerault I was
      informed by the servant I addressed that he was within, but that at the
      moment he had a visitor. I replied that I would wait, and demanded a
      private room, since I desired to avoid meeting any Court acquaintances who
      might chance into the auberge before I had seen the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      My apparel at the moment may not have been all that could have been
      desired, but when a gentleman&rsquo;s rearing has taken place amid an army of
      servitors to minister to his every wish, he is likely to have acquired an
      air that is wont to win him obedience. With all celerity was I ushered
      into a small chamber, opening on the one side upon the common room, and
      being divided on the other by the thinnest of wooden partitions from the
      adjoining apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, the landlord having left me, I disposed myself to wait, and here I
      did a thing I would not have believed myself capable of doing, a thing I
      cannot think of without blushing to this very day. In short, I played the
      eavesdropper&mdash;I, Marcel Saint-Pol de Bardelys. Yet, if you who read
      and are nice-minded, shudder at this confession, or, worse still, shrug
      your shoulders in contempt, with the reflection that such former conduct
      of mine as I have avowed had already partly disposed you against surprise
      at this I do but ask that you measure my sin by my temptation, and think
      honestly whether in my position you might not yourselves have fallen. Aye&mdash;be
      you never so noble and high-principled&mdash;I make bold to say that you
      had done no less, for the voice that penetrated to my ears was that of
      Roxalanne de Lavedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sought an audience with the King,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;but I could not
      gain his presence. They told me that he was holding no levees, and that he
      refused to see any one not introduced by one of those having the private
      entree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; answered the voice of Chatellerault, in tones that were
      perfectly colourless, &ldquo;you come to me that I may present you to his
      Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have guessed it, Monsieur le Comte. You are the only gentleman of His
      Majesty&rsquo;s suite, with whom I can claim acquaintance&mdash;however slight&mdash;and,
      moreover, it is well known how high you stand in his royal favour. I was
      told that they that have a boon to crave can find no better sponsor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you gone to the King, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;had you gained
      audience, he would have directed you to make your appeal to me. I am his
      Commissioner in Languedoc, and the prisoners attainted with high treason
      are my property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, monsieur,&rdquo; she cried in an eager voice, that set my pulses
      throbbing, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not deny me the boon I crave? You&rsquo;ll not deny me his
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a short laugh from Chatellerault, and I could hear the
      deliberate fall of his feet as he paced the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, you must not overrate my powers. You must not
      forget that I am the slave of Justice. You may be asking more than is in
      my power to grant. What can you advance to show that I should be justified
      in proceeding as you wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helas, monsieur, I can advance nothing but my prayers and the assurance
      that a hideous mistake is being made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your interest in this Monsieur de Lesperon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not Monsieur de Lesperon,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, since you cannot tell me who he is, you must be content that we
      speak of him at least as Lesperon,&rdquo; said he, and I could imagine the evil
      grin with which he would accompany the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The better that you may appreciate that which followed, let me here impart
      to you the suspicions which were already sinking into my mind, to be
      changed later into absolute convictions touching the course the Count
      intended to pursue concerning me. The sudden arrival of the King had
      thrown him into some measure of panic, and no longer daring to carry out
      his plans concerning me, it was his object, I made no doubt, to set me at
      liberty that very evening. Ere he did so, however, and presuming upon my
      ignorance of His Majesty&rsquo;s presence in Toulouse, Chatellerault would of a
      certainty have bound me down by solemn promise&mdash;making that promise
      the price of my liberty and my life&mdash;to breathe no word of my
      captivity and trial. No doubt, his cunning brain would have advanced me
      plausible and convincing reasons so to engage myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not calculated upon Castelroux, nor that the King should already
      have heard of my detention. Now that Roxalanne came to entreat him to do
      that which already he saw himself forced to do, he turned his attention to
      the profit that he might derive from her interestedness on my behalf. I
      could guess also something of the jealous rage that must fill him at this
      signal proof of my success with her, and already I anticipated, I think,
      the bargain that he would drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, then,&rdquo; he was repeating, &ldquo;what is your interest in this
      gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. I could imagine her gentle face clouded with the
      trouble that sprang from devising an&rsquo; answer to that question; I could
      picture her innocent eyes cast down, her delicate cheeks pinked by some
      measure of shame, as at last, in a low, stifled voice, the four words
      broke from her &ldquo;I love him, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Dieu! To hear her confess it so! If yesternight it had stirred me to
      the very depths of my poor, sinful soul to have her say so much to me, how
      infinitely more did it not affect me to overhear this frank avowal of it
      to another! And to think that she was undergoing all this to the end that
      she might save me!
    </p>
    <p>
      From Chatellerault there came an impatient snort in answer, and his feet
      again smote the floor as he resumed the pacing that for a moment he had
      suspended. Then followed a pause, a long silence, broken only by the
      Count&rsquo;s restless walking to and fro. At last &ldquo;Why are you silent,
      monsieur?&rdquo; she asked in a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helas, mademoiselle, I can do nothing. I had feared that it might be thus
      with you; and, if I put the question, it was in the hope that I was
      wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he, monsieur?&rdquo; she exclaimed in anguish. &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, mademoiselle, if it lay in my power I would save him were he
      never so guilty, if only that I might spare you sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with tender regret, foul hypocrite that he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; she cried, and her voice was of horror and despair. &ldquo;You do
      not mean that&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short; and then, after a pause, it was
      the Count who finished the sentence for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, mademoiselle, that this Lesperon must die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      You will marvel that I let her suffer so, that I did not break down the
      partition with my hands and strike that supple gentleman dead at her feet
      in atonement for the anguish he was causing her. But I had a mind to see
      how far he would drive this game he was engaged upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a spell of silence, and at last, when Mademoiselle spoke,
      I was amazed at the calm voice in which she addressed him, marvelling at
      the strength and courage of one so frail and childlike to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your determination, indeed, irrevocable, monsieur? If you have any
      pity, will you not at least let me bear my prayers and my tears to the
      King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would avail you nothing. As I have said, the Languedoc rebels are in
      my hands.&rdquo; He paused as if to let those words sink well into her
      understanding; then, &ldquo;If I were to set him at liberty, mademoiselle, if I
      were to spirit him out of prison in the night, bribing his jailers to keep
      silent and binding him by oath to quit France at once and never to betray
      me, I should be, myself, guilty of high treason. Thus alone could the
      thing be done, and you will see, mademoiselle, that by doing it I should
      be endangering my neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an ineffable undercurrent of meaning in his words&mdash;an
      intangible suggestion that he might be bribed to do all this to which he
      so vaguely alluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered, choking&mdash;&ldquo;I understand that
      it would be too much to ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be much, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he returned quickly, and his voice was
      now subdued and invested with an odd quiver. &ldquo;But nothing that your lips
      might ask of me and that it might lie in the power of mortal man to do,
      would be too much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean?&rdquo; she cried, a catch in her breath. Had she guessed&mdash;as I,
      without sight of her face, had guessed&mdash;what was to follow? My gorge
      was rising fast. I clenched my hands, and by an effort I restrained myself
      to learn that I had guessed aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some two months ago,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I journeyed to Lavedan, as you may
      remember. I saw you, mademoiselle&mdash;for a brief while only, it is true&mdash;and
      ever since I have seen nothing else but you.&rdquo; His voice went a shade
      lower, and passion throbbed in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, too, perceived it, for the grating of a chair informed me that she
      had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, monsieur&mdash;not now!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This is not the season.
      I beg of you think of my desolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, mademoiselle, and I respect your grief, and, with all my heart,
      believe me, I share it. Yet this is the season, and if you have this man&rsquo;s
      interests at heart, you will hear me to the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all the imperiousness of his tone an odd note of respect&mdash;real
      or assumed&mdash;was sounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you suffer, mademoiselle, believe me that I suffer also, and if I make
      you suffer more by what I say, I beg that you will think how what you have
      said, how the very motive of your presence here, has made me suffer. Do
      you know, mademoiselle, what it is to be torn by jealousy? Can you imagine
      it? If you can, you can imagine also something of the torture I endured
      when you confessed to me that you loved this Lesperon, when you interceded
      for his life. Mademoiselle, I love you&mdash;with all my heart and soul I
      love you. I have loved you, I think, since the first moment of our meeting
      at Lavedan, and to win you there is no risk that I would not take, no
      danger that I would not brave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I implore you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me out, mademoiselle!&rdquo; he cried. Then in quieter voice he proceeded:
      &ldquo;At present you love this Monsieur de Lesperon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always love him! Always, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, wait, wait!&rdquo; he exclaimed, annoyed by her interruption. &ldquo;If he were
      to live, and you were to wed him and be daily in his company, I make no
      doubt your love might endure. But if he were to die, or if he were to pass
      into banishment and you were to see him no more, you would mourn him for a
      little while, and then&mdash;Helas! it is the way of men and women&mdash;time
      would heal first your sorrow, then your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, monsieur&mdash;oh, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am older, child, than you are. I know. At present you are anxious to
      save his life anxious because you love him, and also because you betrayed
      him, and you would not have his death upon your conscience.&rdquo; He paused a
      moment; then raising his voice, &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I offer you your
      lover&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, monsieur!&rdquo; cried the poor child, &ldquo;I knew you were good! I knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment! Do not misapprehend me. I do not say that I give it&mdash;I
      offer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That if you would have it, mademoiselle, you must buy it. I have said
      that for you I would brave all dangers. To save your lover, I brave the
      scaffold. If I am betrayed, or if the story transpire, my head will
      assuredly fall in the place of Lesperon&rsquo;s. This I will risk, mademoiselle&mdash;I
      will do it gladly&mdash;if you will promise to become my wife when it is
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moan from Roxalanne, then silence; then&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, monsieur,
      you are pitiless! What bargain is this that you offer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fair one, surely,&rdquo; said that son of hell&mdash;&ldquo;a very fair one. The
      risk of my life against your hand in marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&mdash;if you truly loved me as you say, monsieur,&rdquo; she reasoned,
      &ldquo;you would serve me without asking guerdon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any other thing I would. But is it fair to ask a man who is racked by
      love of you to place another in your arms, and that at the risk of his own
      life? Ah, mademoiselle, I am but a man, and I am subject to human
      weaknesses. If you will consent, this Lesperon shall go free, but you must
      see him no more; and I will carry my consideration so far as to give you
      six months in which to overcome your sorrow, ere I present myself to you
      again to urge my suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I refuse, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the value which I set upon my life you must add my very human
      jealousy. From such a combination what can you hope for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, in short, that he must die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; was that infernal cheat&rsquo;s laconic answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent a little while, then she fell a-sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be pitiful, monsieur! Have mercy if you, indeed, love me. Oh, he must not
      die! I cannot, I dare not, let him die! Save him, monsieur, and I will
      pray for you every night of my life; I will pray for you to our Holy
      Mother as I am now praying to you for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lived there the man to resist that innocent, devout appeal? Lived there
      one who in answer to such gentle words of love and grief could obtrude his
      own coarse passions? It seems there did, for all he answered was &ldquo;You know
      the price, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And God pity me! I must pay it. I must, for if he dies I shall have his
      blood upon my conscience!&rdquo; Then she checked her grief, and her voice grew
      almost stern in the restraint she set upon herself. &ldquo;If I give you my
      promise to wed you hereafter&mdash;say in six months&rsquo; time&mdash;what
      proof will you afford me that he who is detained under the name of
      Lesperon shall go free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught the sound of something very like a gasp from the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain in Toulouse until to-morrow, and to-night ere he departs he shall
      come to take his leave of you. Are you content?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last I leapt to my feet. I could endure no more. You may marvel
      that I had had the heart to endure so much, and to have so let her suffer
      that I might satisfy myself how far this scoundrel Chatellerault would
      drive his trickster&rsquo;s bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more impetuous man would have beaten down the partition, or shouted to
      her through it the consolation that Chatellerault&rsquo;s bargain was no bargain
      at all, since I was already at large. And that is where a more impetuous
      man would have acted upon instinct more wisely than did I upon reason.
      Instead, I opened the door, and, crossing the common room, I flung myself
      down a passage that I thought must lead to the chamber in which they were
      closeted. But in this I was at fault, and ere I had come upon a waiter and
      been redirected some precious moments were lost. He led me back through
      the common room to a door opening upon another corridor. He pushed it
      wide, and I came suddenly face to face with Chatellerault, still flushed
      from his recent contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here!&rdquo; he gasped, his jaw falling, and his cheeks turning pale, as
      well they might; for all that he could not dream I had overheard his
      bargaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go back, if you please, Monsieur le Comte.&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back where?&rdquo; he asked stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to Mademoiselle. Back to the room you have just quitted.&rdquo; And none
      too gently I pushed him into the corridor again, and so, in the gloom, I
      missed the expression of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not there,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, we will go back,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I had my way, and we gained the room where his infamous traffic had
      been held. Yet for once he spoke the truth. She was no longer there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; I demanded angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; he answered; and when I protested that I had not met her, &ldquo;You
      would not have a lady go by way of the public room, would you?&rdquo; he
      demanded insolently. &ldquo;She left by the side door into the courtyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being so, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; said I quietly, &ldquo;I will have a little
      talk with you before going after her.&rdquo; And I carefully closed the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. MONSIEUR DE CHATELLERAULT IS ANGRY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within the room Chatellerault and I faced each other in silence. And how
      vastly changed were the circumstances since our last meeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      The disorder that had stamped itself upon his countenance when first he
      had beheld me still prevailed. There was a lowering, sullen look in his
      eyes and a certain displacement of their symmetry which was peculiar to
      them when troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a cunning plotter and a scheming intriguer in his own interests,
      Chatellerault, as I have said before, was not by nature a quick man. His
      wits worked slowly, and he needed leisure to consider a situation and his
      actions therein ere he was in a position to engage with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; quoth I ironically, &ldquo;I make you my compliments upon
      your astuteness and the depth of your schemes, and my condolences upon the
      little accident owing to which I am here, and in consequence of which your
      pretty plans are likely to miscarry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw back his great head like a horse that feels the curb, and his
      smouldering eyes looked up at me balefully. Then his sensuous lips parted
      in scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you know?&rdquo; he demanded with sullen contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been in that room for the half of an hour,&rdquo; I answered, rapping
      the partition with my knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dividing wall, as you will observe, is thin, and I heard everything
      that passed between you and Mademoiselle de Lavedan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that Bardelys, known as the Magnificent; Bardelys the mirror of
      chivalry; Bardelys the arbiter elegantiarum of the Court of France, is no
      better, it seems, than a vulgar spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he sought by that word to anger me, he failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Count,&rdquo; I answered him very quietly, &ldquo;you are of an age to know that
      the truth alone has power to wound. I was in that room by accident, and
      when the first words of your conversation reached me I had not been human
      had I not remained and strained my ears to catch every syllable you
      uttered. For the rest, let me ask you, my dear Chatellerault, since when
      have you become so nice that you dare cast it at a man that he has been
      eavesdropping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are obscure, monsieur. What is it that you suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am signifying that when a man stands unmasked for a cheat, a liar, and
      a thief, his own character should give him concern enough to restrain him
      from strictures upon that of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A red flush showed through the tan of his skin, then faded and left him
      livid&mdash;a very evil sight, as God lives. He flung his
      heavily-feathered hat upon the table, and carried his hand to his hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You shall answer me for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head and smiled; but I made no sign of drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, we must talk a while. I think that you had better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his sullen eyes to mine. Perhaps the earnest impressiveness of
      my tones prevailed. Be that as it may, his half-drawn sword was thrust
      back with a click, and &ldquo;What have you to say?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated.&rdquo; I motioned him to a chair by the table and when he had taken
      it I sat down opposite to him. Taking up a quill, I dipped it in the
      ink-horn that stood by, and drew towards me a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you lured me into the wager touching Mademoiselle de Lavedan,&rdquo; said
      I calmly, &ldquo;you did so, counting upon certain circumstances, of which you
      alone had knowledge, that should render impossible the urging of my suit.
      That, Monsieur le Comte, was undeniably the action of a cheat. Was it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; he roared, and would have risen, but, my hand upon his arm, I
      restrained him and pressed him back into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a sequence of fortuitous circumstances,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;it became
      possible for me to circumvent the obstacle upon which you had based your
      calculations. Those same circumstances led later to my being arrested in
      error and in place of another man. You discovered how I had contravened
      the influence upon which you counted; you trembled to see how the
      unexpected had befriended me, and you began to fear for your wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do? Seeing me arraigned before you in your quality as King&rsquo;s
      Commissioner, you pretended to no knowledge of me; you became blind to my
      being any but Lesperon the rebel, and you sentenced me to death in his
      place, so that being thus definitely removed I should be unable to carry
      out my undertaking, and my lands should consequently pass into your
      possession. That, monsieur, was at once the act of a thief and a murderer.
      Wait, monsieur; restrain yourself until I shall have done. To-day again
      fortune comes to my rescue. Again you see me slipping from your grasp, and
      you are in despair. Then, in the eleventh hour, Mademoiselle de Lavedan
      comes to you to plead for my life. By that act she gives you the most
      ample proof that your wager is lost. What would a gentleman, a man of
      honour, have done under these circumstances? What did you do? You seized
      that last chance; you turned it to the best account; you made this poor
      girl buy something from you; you made her sell herself to you for nothing&mdash;pretending
      that your nothing was a something of great value. What term shall we apply
      to that? To say that you cheated again seems hardly adequate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, Bardelys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; I thundered, looking him straight between the eyes, so that again
      he sank back cowed. Then resuming the calm with which hitherto I had
      addressed him, &ldquo;Your cupidity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your greed for the estates of
      Bardelys, and your jealousy and thirst to see me impoverished and so
      ousted from my position at Court, to leave you supreme in His Majesty&rsquo;s
      favour, have put you to strange shifts for a gentleman, Chatellerault.
      Yet, wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, dipping my pen in the ink-horn, I began to write. I was conscious of
      his eyes upon me, and I could imagine his surmisings and bewildered
      speculations as my pen scratched rapidly across the paper. In a few
      moments it was done, and I tossed the pen aside. I took up the sandbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man cheats, Monsieur le Comte, and is detected, he is invariably
      adjudged the loser of his stakes. On that count alone everything that you
      have is now mine by rights.&rdquo; Again I had to quell an interruption. &ldquo;But if
      we wave that point, and proceed upon the supposition that you have dealt
      fairly and honourably with me, why, then, monsieur, you have still
      sufficient evidence&mdash;the word of Mademoiselle, herself, in fact&mdash;that
      I have won my wager. And so, if we take this, the most lenient view of the
      case&rdquo;&mdash;I paused to sprinkle the sand over my writing&mdash;&ldquo;your
      estates are still lost to you, and pass to be my property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they, by God?&rdquo; he roared, unable longer to restrain himself, and
      leaping to his feet. &ldquo;You have done, have you not? You have said all that
      you can call to mind? You have flung insults and epithets at me enough to
      earn the cutting of a dozen throats. You have dubbed me cheat and thief&rdquo;&mdash;he
      choked in his passion&mdash;&ldquo;until you have had your fill&mdash;is it not
      so? Now, listen to me, Master Bardelys, master spy, master buffoon, master
      masquerader! What manner of proceeding was yours to go to Lavedan under a
      false name? How call you that? Was that, perhaps, not cheating?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, it was not,&rdquo; I answered quietly. &ldquo;It was in the terms of
      your challenge that I was free to go to Lavedan in what guise I listed,
      employing what wiles I pleased. But let that be,&rdquo; I ended, and, creasing
      the paper, I poured the sand back into the box, and dusted the document.
      &ldquo;The point is hardly worth discussing at this time of day. If not one way,
      why, then, in another, your wager is lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; He set his arms akimbo and eyed me derisively, his thick-set
      frame planted squarely before me. &ldquo;You are satisfied that it is so? Quite
      satisfied, eh?&rdquo; He leered in my face. &ldquo;Why, then, Monsieur le Marquis, we
      will see whether a few inches of steel will win it back for me.&rdquo; And once
      more his hand flew to his hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising, I flung the document I had accomplished upon the table. &ldquo;Glance
      first at that,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped to look at me in inquiry, my manner sowing so great a curiosity
      in him that his passion was all scattered before it. Then he stepped up to
      the table and lifted the paper. As he read, his hand shook, amazement
      dilated his eyes and furrowed his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what does it signify?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It signifies that, although fully conscious of having won, I prefer to
      acknowledge that I have lost. I make over to you thus my estates of
      Bardelys, because, monsieur, I have come to realize that that wager was an
      infamous one&mdash;one in which a gentleman should have had no part&mdash;and
      the only atonement I can make to myself, my honour, and the lady whom we
      insulted&mdash;is that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; he complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apprehend your difficulty, Comte. The point is a nice one. But
      understand at least that my Picardy estates are yours. Only, monsieur, you
      will be well advised to make your will forthwith, for you are not
      destined, yourself, to enjoy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me, his glance charged with inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty,&rdquo; I continued, in answer to his glance, &ldquo;is ordering your
      arrest for betraying the trust he had reposed in you and for perverting
      the ends of justice to do your own private murdering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; he cried, falling of a sudden unto a most pitiful affright.
      &ldquo;The King knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows?&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;In the excitement of these other matters you have
      forgotten to ask how I come to be at liberty. I have been to the King,
      monsieur, and I have told him what has taken place here at Toulouse, and
      how I was to have gone to the block tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scelerat!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have ruined me!&rdquo; Rage and grief were blent in
      his accents. He stood before me, livid of face and with hands clenching
      and unclenching at his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect me to keep such a matter silent? Even had I been so
      inclined it had not been easy, for His Majesty had questions to ask me.
      From what the King said, monsieur, you may count upon mounting the
      scaffold in my stead. So be advised, and make your will without delay, if
      you would have your heirs enjoy my Picardy chateau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I have seen terror and anger distort men&rsquo;s countenances, but never have I
      seen aught to compare with the disorder of Chatellerault at that moment.
      He stamped and raved and fumed. He poured forth a thousand ordures of
      speech in his frenzy; he heaped insults upon me and imprecations upon the
      King, whose lapdog he pronounced me. His short, stout frame was quivering
      with passion and fear, his broad face distorted by his hideous grimaces of
      rage. And then, while yet his ravings were in full flow, the door opened,
      and in stepped the airy Chevalier de Saint-Eustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still, amazed, beneath the lintel&mdash;marvelling to see all
      this anger, and abashed at beholding me. His sudden appearance reminded me
      that I had last seen him at Grenade in the Count&rsquo;s company, on the day of
      my arrest. The surprise it had occasioned me now returned upon seeing him
      so obviously and intimately seeking Chatellerault.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count turned on him in his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, popinjay?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte!&rdquo; cried the other, in blent indignation and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will perceive that you are come inopportunely,&rdquo; I put in. &ldquo;Monsieur
      de Chatellerault is not quite himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But my speech again drew his attention to my presence; and the wonder grew
      in his eyes at finding me there, for to him I was still Lesperon the
      rebel, and he marvelled naturally that I should be at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the corridor there was a sound of steps and voices, and as I
      turned I beheld in the doorway, behind Saint-Eustache, the faces of
      Castelroux, Mironsac, and my old acquaintance, the babbling, irresponsible
      buffoon, La Fosse. From Mironsac he had heard of my presence in Toulouse,
      and, piloted by Castelroux, they were both come to seek me out. I&rsquo;ll swear
      it was not thus they had looked to find me.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pushed their way into the room, impelling Saint-Eustache forward, and
      there were greetings exchanged and felicitations, whilst Chatellerault,
      curbing his disorder, drew the Chevalier into a corner of the room, and
      stood there listening to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length I heard the Count exclaim&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do as you please, Chevalier. If you have interests of your own to serve,
      serve them. As for myself&mdash;I am past being interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, monsieur?&rdquo; the chevalier inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; echoed Chatellerault, his ferocity welling up again. Then, swinging
      round, he came straight at me, as a bull makes a charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Bardelys!&rdquo; he blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bardelys!&rdquo; gasped Saint-Eustache in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; I inquired coldly, turning from my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you said may be true, and I may be doomed, but I swear before
      God that you shall not go unpunished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, monsieur, that you run a grave risk of perjuring yourself!&rdquo; I
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall render me satisfaction ere we part!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not deem that paper satisfaction enough, then, monsieur,
      forgive me, but your greed transcends all possibility of being ever
      satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take your paper and your estates! What shall they profit me
      when I am dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They may profit your heirs,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall that profit me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a riddle that I cannot pretend to elucidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh, you knave!&rdquo; he snorted. Then, with an abrupt change of manner,
      &ldquo;You do not lack for friends,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Beg one of these gentlemen to act
      for you, and if you are a man of honour let us step out into the yard and
      settle the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so much a man of honour as to be careful with whom I cross steel. I
      prefer to leave you to His Majesty&rsquo;s vengeance; his headsman may be less
      particular than am I. No, monsieur, on the whole, I do not think that I
      can fight you.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
His face grew a shade paler. It became grey; the jaw was set, and the
eyes were more out of symmetry than I had ever seen them. Their glance
approached what is known in Italy as the mal&rsquo;occhio, and to protect
themselves against the baneful influences of which men carry charms. A
moment he stood so, eyeing me. Then, coming a step nearer&mdash;

 &ldquo;You do not think that you can fight me, eh?  You do not think it?
Pardieu! How shall I make you change your mind? To the insult of words
you appear impervious. You imagine your courage above dispute because by
a lucky accident you killed La Vertoile some years ago and the fame of
it has attached to you.&rdquo; In the intensity of his anger he was breathing
heavily, like a man overburdened. &ldquo;You have been living ever since by
the reputation which that accident gave you. Let us see if you can die
by it, Monsieur de Bardelys.&rdquo; And, leaning forward, he struck me on
the breast, so suddenly and so powerfully&mdash;for he was a man of abnormal
strength&mdash;that I must have fallen but that La Fosse caught me in his
arms.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo; lisped the classic-minded fool. &ldquo;Play Theseus to this bull of
      Marathon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatellerault stood back, his hands on his hips, his head inclined towards
      his right shoulder, and an insolent leer of expectancy upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will that resolve you?&rdquo; he sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will meet you,&rdquo; I answered, when I had recovered breath. &ldquo;But I swear
      that I shall not help you to escape the headsman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I not know it?&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;How shall killing you help me to escape?
      Come, messieurs, sortons. At once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sor,&rdquo; I answered shortly; and thereupon we crowded from the room, and
      went pele-mele down the passage to the courtyard at the back.

      CHAPTER XVI. SWORDS!
    </h2>
    <p>
      La Fosse led the way with me, his arm through mine, swearing that he would
      be my second. He had such a stomach for a fight, had this irresponsible,
      irrepressible rhymester, that it mounted to the heights of passion with
      him, and when I mentioned, in answer to a hint dropped in connection with
      the edict, that I had the King&rsquo;s sanction for this combat, he was nearly
      mad with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood of La Fosse!&rdquo; was his oath. &ldquo;The honour to stand by you shall be
      mine, my Bardelys! You owe it me, for am I not in part to blame for all
      this ado? Nay, you&rsquo;ll not deny me. That gentleman yonder, with the
      wild-cat moustaches and a name like a Gascon oath&mdash;that cousin of
      Mironsac&rsquo;s, I mean&mdash;has the flair of a fight in his nostrils, and a
      craving to be in it. But you&rsquo;ll grant me the honour, will you not?
      Pardieu! It will earn me a place in history.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the graveyard,&rdquo; quoth I, by way of cooling his ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peste! What an augury!&rdquo; Then, with a laugh: &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, indicating
      Saint-Eustache, &ldquo;that long, lean saint&mdash;I forget of what he is patron&mdash;hardly
      wears a murderous air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To win peace from him, I promised that he should stand by me. But the
      favour lost much of its value in his eyes when presently I added that I
      did not wish the seconds to engage, since the matter was of so very
      personal a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mironsac and Castelroux, assisted by Saint-Eustache, closed the heavy
      portecochere, and so shut us in from the observation of passers-by. The
      clanging of those gates brought the landlord and a couple of his knaves,
      and we were subjected to the prayers and intercessions, to the stormings
      and ravings that are ever the prelude of a stable-yard fight, but which
      invariably end, as these ended, in the landlord&rsquo;s withdrawal to run for
      help to the nearest corps-de-garde.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my myrmillones,&rdquo; cried La Fosse in bloodthirsty jubilation, &ldquo;to work
      before the host returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po&rsquo; Cap de Dieu!&rdquo; growled Castelroux, &ldquo;is this a time for jests, master
      joker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jests?&rdquo; I heard him retorting, as he assisted me to doff my doublet. &ldquo;Do
      I jest? Diable! you Gascons are a slow-witted folk! I have a taste for
      allegory, my friend, but that never yet was accounted so low a thing as
      jesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last we were ready, and I shifted the whole of my attention to the
      short, powerful figure of Chatellerault as he advanced upon me, stripped
      to the waist, his face set and his eyes full of stern resolve. Despite his
      low stature, and the breadth of frame which argue sluggish motion, there
      was something very formidable about the Count. His bared arms were great
      masses of muscular flesh, and if his wrist were but half as supple as it
      looked powerful, that alone should render him a dangerous antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I had no qualm of fear, no doubt, even, touching the issue. Not that I
      was an habitual ferrailleur. As I have indicated, I had fought but one man
      in all my life. Nor yet am I of those who are said to know no fear under
      any circumstances. Such men are not truly brave; they are stupid and
      unimaginative, in proof of which I will advance the fact that you may
      incite a timid man to deeds of reckless valour by drugging him with wine.
      But this is by the way. It may be that the very regular fencing practice
      that in Paris I was wont to take may so have ordered my mind that the fact
      of meeting unbaited steel had little power to move me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, I engaged the Count without a tremor either of the
      flesh or of the spirit. I was resolved to wait and let him open the play,
      that I might have an opportunity of measuring his power and seeing how
      best I might dispose of him. I was determined to do him no hurt, and to
      leave him, as I had sworn, to the headsman; and so, either by pressure or
      by seizure, it was my aim to disarm him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on his side also he entered upon the duel with all caution and
      wariness. From his rage I had hoped for a wild, angry rush that should
      afford me an easy opportunity of gaining my ends with him. Not so,
      however. Now that he came with steel to defend his life and to seek mine,
      he appeared to have realized the importance of having keen wits to guide
      his hand; and so he put his anger from him, and emerged calm and
      determined from his whilom disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some preliminary passes we made from the first engagement in the lines of
      tierce, each playing warily for an opening, yet neither of us giving
      ground or betraying haste or excitement. Now his blade slithered on mine
      with a ceaseless tremor; his eyes watched mine from under lowering brows,
      and with knees bent he crouched like a cat making ready for a spring. Then
      it came. Sudden as lightning was his disengage; he darted under my guard,
      then over it, then back and under it again, and stretching out in the
      lunge&mdash;his double-feint completed&mdash;he straightened his arm to
      drive home the botte.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with a flying point I cleared his blade out of the line of my body.
      There had been two sharp tinkles of our meeting swords, and now
      Chatellerault stood at his fullest stretch, the half of his steel past and
      behind me, for just a fraction of time completely at my mercy. Yet I was
      content to stand, and never move my blade from his until he had recovered
      and we were back in our first position once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard the deep bass of Castelroux&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mordieux!&rdquo; the sharp gasp of fear
      from Saint-Eustache, who already in imagination beheld his friend
      stretched lifeless on the ground, and the cry of mortification from La
      Fosse as the Count recovered. But I heeded these things little. As I have
      said, to kill the Count was not my object. It had been wise, perhaps, in
      Chatellerault to have appreciated that fact; but he did not. From the
      manner in which he now proceeded to press me, I was assured that he set
      his having recovered guard to slowness on my part, never thinking of the
      speed that had been necessary to win myself such an opening as I had
      obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      My failure to run him through in that moment of jeopardy inspired him with
      a contempt of my swordplay. This he now made plain by the recklessness
      with which he fenced, in his haste to have done ere we might chance to be
      interrupted. Of this recklessness I suddenly availed myself to make an
      attempt at disarming him. I turned aside a vicious thrust by a close&mdash;a
      dangerously close&mdash;parry, and whilst in the act of encircling his
      blade I sought by pressure to carry it out of his hand. I was within an
      ace of succeeding, yet he avoided me, and doubled back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized then, perhaps, that I was not quite so contemptible an
      antagonist as he had been imagining, and he went back to his earlier and
      more cautious tactics. Then I changed my plans. I simulated an attack, and
      drove him hard for some moments. Strong he was, but there were advantages
      of reach and suppleness with me, and even these advantages apart, had I
      aimed at his life, I could have made short work of him. But the game I
      played was fraught with perils to myself, and once I was in deadly danger,
      and as near death from the sword as a man may go and live. My attack had
      lured him, as I desired that it should, into making a riposte. He did so,
      and as his blade twisted round mine and came slithering at me, I again
      carried it off by encircling it, and again I exerted pressure to deprive
      him of it. But this time I was farther from success than before. He
      laughed at the attempt, as with a suddenness that I had been far from
      expecting he disengaged again, and his point darted like a snake upwards
      at my throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I parried that thrust, but I only parried it when it was within some three
      inches of my neck, and even as I turned it aside it missed me as narrowly
      as it might without tearing my skin. The imminence of the peril had been
      such that, as we mutually recovered, I found a cold sweat bathing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, I resolved to abandon the attempt to disarm him by pressure,
      and I turned my attention to drawing him into a position that might lend
      itself to seizure. But even as I was making up my mind to this&mdash;we
      were engaged in sixte at the time&mdash;I saw a sudden chance. His point
      was held low while he watched me; so low that his arm was uncovered and my
      point was in line with it. To see the opening, to estimate it, and to take
      my resolve was all the work of a fraction of a second. The next instant I
      had straightened my elbow, my blade shot out in a lightning stroke and
      transfixed his sword-arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a yell of pain, followed by a deep growl of fury, as, wounded
      but not vanquished, the enraged Count caught his falling sword in his left
      hand, and whilst my own blade was held tight in the bone of his right arm,
      he sought to run me through. I leapt quickly aside, and then, before he
      could renew the attempt, my friends had fallen upon him and wrenched his
      sword from his hand and mine from his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would ill have become me to taunt a man in his sorry condition, else
      might I now have explained to him what I had meant when I had promised to
      leave him for the headsman even though I did consent to fight him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mironsac, Castelroux, and La Fosse stood babbling around me, but I paid no
      heed either to Castelroux&rsquo;s patois or to La Fosse&rsquo;s misquotations of
      classic authors. The combat had been protracted, and the methods I had
      pursued had been of a very exhausting nature. I leaned now against the
      porte-cochere, and mopped myself vigorously. Then Saint-Eustache, who was
      engaged in binding up his principal&rsquo;s arm, called to La Fosse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed my second with my eyes as he went across to Chatellerault. The
      Count stood white, his lips compressed, no doubt from the pain his arm was
      causing him. Then his voice floated across to me as he addressed La Fosse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do me the favour, monsieur, to inform your friend that this was
      no first blood combat, but one a outrance. I fence as well with my left
      arm as with my right, and if Monsieur de Bardelys will do me the honour to
      engage again, I shall esteem it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Fosse bowed and came over with the message that already we had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fought,&rdquo; said I in answer, &ldquo;in a spirit very different from that by
      which Monsieur de Chatellerault appears to have been actuated. He made it
      incumbent upon me to afford proof of my courage. That proof I have
      afforded; I decline to do more. Moreover, as Monsieur de Chatellerault
      himself must perceive, the light is failing us, and in a few minutes it
      will be too dark for sword-play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a few minutes there will be need for none, monsieur,&rdquo; shouted
      Chatellerault, to save time. He was boastful to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, monsieur, in any case, come those who will resolve the question,&rdquo; I
      answered, pointing to the door of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I spoke, the landlord stepped into the yard, followed by an officer and
      a half-dozen soldiers. These were no ordinary keepers of the peace, but
      musketeers of the guard, and at sight of them I knew that their business
      was not to interrupt a duel, but to arrest my erstwhile opponent upon a
      much graver charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer advanced straight to Chatellerault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s name, Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I demand your sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that at bottom I was still a man of soft heart, unfeeling cynic
      though they accounted me; for upon remarking the misery and gloom that
      spread upon Chatellerault&rsquo;s face I was sorry for him, notwithstanding the
      much that he had schemed against me. Of what his fate would be he could
      have no shadow of doubt. He knew&mdash;none better&mdash;how truly the
      King loved me, and how he would punish such an attempt as had been made
      upon my life, to say nothing of the prostitution of justice of which he
      had been guilty, and for which alone he had earned the penalty of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment with bent head, the pain of his arm possibly forgotten
      in the agony of his spirit. Then, straightening himself suddenly, with a
      proud, half scornful air, he looked the officer straight between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You desire my sword, monsieur?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musketeer bowed respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint-Eustache, will you do me the favour to give it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while the Chevalier picked up the rapier from the ground where it had
      been flung, that man waited with an outward calm for which at the moment I
      admired him, as we must ever admire a tranquil bearing in one smitten by a
      great adversity. And than this I can conceive few greater. He had played
      for much, and he had lost everything. Ignominy, degradation, and the block
      were all that impended for him in this world, and they were very imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the sword from the Chevalier. He held it for a second by the hilt,
      like one in thought, like one who is resolving upon something, whilst the
      musketeer awaited his good pleasure with that deference which all gentle
      minds must accord to the unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still holding his rapier, he raised his eyes for a second and let them
      rest on me with a grim malevolence. Then he uttered a short laugh, and,
      shrugging his shoulders, he transferred his grip to the blade, as if about
      to offer the hilt to the officer. Holding it so, halfway betwixt point and
      quillons, he stepped suddenly back, and before any there could put forth a
      hand to stay him, he had set the pummel on the ground and the point at his
      breast, and so dropped upon it and impaled himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry went up from every throat, and we sprang towards him. He rolled over
      on his side, and with a grin of exquisite pain, yet in words of
      unconquerable derision &ldquo;You may have my sword now, Monsieur l&rsquo;Officier,&rdquo;
       he said, and sank back, swooning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an oath, the musketeer stepped forward. He obeyed Chatellerault to
      the letter, by kneeling beside him and carefully withdrawing the sword.
      Then he ordered a couple of his men to take up the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; asked some one; and some one else replied, &ldquo;Not yet, but he
      soon will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two of the musketeers bore him into the inn and laid him on the floor of
      the very room in which, an hour or so ago, he had driven a bargain with
      Roxalanne. A cloak rolled into a pillow was thrust under his head, and
      there we left him in charge of his captors, the landlord, Saint-Eustache,
      and La Fosse the latter inspired, I doubt not, by that morbidity which is
      so often a feature of the poetic mind, and which impelled him now to
      witness the death-agony of my Lord of Chatellerault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself, having resumed my garments, I disposed myself to repair at once to
      the Hotel de l&rsquo;Epee, there to seek Roxalanne, that I might set her fears
      and sorrows at rest, and that I might at last make my confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we stepped out into the street, where the dusk was now thickening, I
      turned to Castelroux to inquire how Saint-Eustache came into
      Chatellerault&rsquo;s company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is of the family of the Iscariot, I should opine,&rdquo; answered the
      Gascon. &ldquo;As soon as he had news that Chatellerault was come to Languedoc
      as the King&rsquo;s Commissioner, he repaired to him to offer his services in
      the work of bringing rebels to justice. He urged that his thorough
      acquaintance with the province should render him of value to the King, as
      also that he had had particular opportunities of becoming acquainted with
      many treasonable dealings on the part of men whom the State was far from
      suspecting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mort Dieu!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I had suspected something of such a nature. You do
      well to call him of the family of the Iscariot. He is more so than you
      imagine: I have knowledge of this&mdash;ample knowledge. He was until
      lately a rebel himself, and himself a follower of Gaston d&rsquo;Orleans&mdash;though
      of a lukewarm quality. What reasons have driven him to such work, do you
      know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same reason that impelled his forefather, Judas of old. The desire to
      enrich himself. For every hitherto unsuspected rebel that shall be brought
      to justice and whose treason shall be proven by his agency, he claims the
      half of that rebel&rsquo;s confiscated estates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;And does the Keeper of the Seals sanction this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanction it? Saint-Eustache holds a commission, has a free hand and a
      company of horse to follow him in his rebel-hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he done much so far?&rdquo; was my next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has reduced half a dozen noblemen and their families. The wealth he
      must thereby have amassed should be very considerable, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Castelroux, I will see the King in connection with this pretty
      gentleman, and not only shall we find him a dungeon deep and dank, but we
      shall see that he disgorges his blood-money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can prove his treason you will be doing blessed work,&rdquo; returned
      Castelroux. &ldquo;Until tomorrow, then, for here is the Hotel de l&rsquo;Epee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the broad doorway of an imposing building a warm glow of light issued
      out and spread itself fanwise across the ill-paved street. In this&mdash;like
      bats about a lamp&mdash;flitted the black figures of gaping urchins and
      other stragglers, and into this I now passed, having taken leave of my
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mounted the steps and I was about to cross the threshold, when suddenly
      above a burst of laughter that greeted my ears I caught the sound of a
      singularly familiar voice. This seemed raised at present to address such
      company as might be within. One moment of doubt had I&mdash;for it was a
      month since last I had heard those soft, unctuous accents. Then I was
      assured that the voice I heard was, indeed, the voice of my steward
      Ganymede. Castelroux&rsquo;s messenger had found him at last, it seemed, and had
      brought him to Toulouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was moved to spring into the room and greet that old retainer for whom,
      despite the gross and sensuous ways that with advancing years were
      claiming him more and more, I had a deep attachment. But even as I was on
      the point of entering, not only his voice, but the very words that he was
      uttering floated out to my ears, and they were of a quality that held me
      there to play the hidden listener for the second time in my life in one
      and the same day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. THE BABBLING OF GANYMEDE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Never until that hour, as I stood in the porch of the Hotel de l&rsquo;Epee,
      hearkening to my henchman&rsquo;s narrative and to the bursts of laughter which
      ever and anon it provoked from his numerous listeners, had I dreamed of
      the raconteur talents which Rodenard might boast. Yet was I very far from
      being appreciative now that I discovered them, for the story that he told
      was of how one Marcel Saint-Pol, Marquis de Bardelys, had laid a wager
      with the Comte de Chatellerault that he would woo and win Mademoiselle de
      Lavedan to wife within three months. Nor did he stop there. Rodenard, it
      would seem, was well informed; he had drawn all knowledge of the state of
      things from Castelroux&rsquo;s messenger, and later&mdash;I know not from whom&mdash;at
      Toulouse, since his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regaled the company, therefore, with a recital of our finding the dying
      Lesperon, and of how I had gone off alone, and evidently assumed the name
      and role of that proscribed rebel, and thus conducted my wooing under
      sympathy inspiring circumstances at Lavedan. Then came, he announced, the
      very cream of the jest, when I was arrested as Lesperon and brought to
      Toulouse and to trial in Lesperon&rsquo;s stead; he told them how I had been
      sentenced to death in the other man&rsquo;s place, and he assured them that I
      would certainly have been beheaded upon the morrow but that news had been
      borne to him&mdash;Rodenard&mdash;of my plight, and he was come to deliver
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse upon hearing him tell of the wager had been to stride
      into the room and silence him by my coming. That I did not obey that
      impulse was something that presently I was very bitterly to regret. How it
      came that I did not I scarcely know. I was tempted, perhaps, to see how
      far this henchman whom for years I had trusted was unworthy of that trust.
      And so, there in the porch, I stayed until he had ended by telling the
      company that he was on his way to inform the King&mdash;who by great good
      chance was that day arrived in Toulouse&mdash;of the mistake that had been
      made, and thus obtain my immediate enlargement and earn my undying
      gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I was on the point of entering to administer a very stern reproof to
      that talkative rogue, when of a sudden there was a commotion within. I
      caught a scraping of chairs, a dropping of voices, and then suddenly I
      found myself confronted by Roxalanne de Lavedan herself, issuing with a
      page and a woman in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For just a second her eyes rested on me, and the light coming through the
      doorway at her back boldly revealed my countenance. And a very startled
      countenance it must have been, for in that fraction of time I knew that
      she had heard all that Rodenard had been relating. Under that instant&rsquo;s
      glance of her eyes I felt myself turn pale; a shiver ran through me, and
      the sweat started cold upon my brow. Then her gaze passed from me, and
      looked beyond into the street, as though she had not known me; whether in
      her turn she paled or reddened I cannot say, for the light was too
      uncertain. Next followed what seemed to me an interminable pause,
      although, indeed, it can have been no more than a matter of seconds&mdash;aye,
      and of but few. Then, her gown drawn well aside, she passed me in that
      same irrecognizing way, whilst I, abashed, shrank back into the shadows of
      the porch, burning with shame and rage and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From under her brows her woman glanced at me inquisitively; her liveried
      page, his nose in the air, eyed me so pertly that I was hard put to it not
      to hasten with my foot his descent of the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they were gone, and from the outside the shrill voice of her page
      was wafted to me. He was calling to the ostler for her carriage. Standing,
      in my deep mortification, where she had passed me, I conjectured from that
      demand that she was journeying to Lavedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew now how she had been cheated on every hand, first by me and
      later, that very afternoon, by Chatellerault, and her resolve to quit
      Toulouse could but signify that she was done with me for good. That it had
      surprised her to find me at large already, I fancied I had seen in her
      momentary glance, but her pride had been quick to conquer and stifle all
      signs of that surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remained where she had passed me until her coach had rumbled away into
      the night, and during the moments that elapsed I had stood arguing with
      myself and resolving upon my course of action. But despair was fastening
      upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had come to the Hotel de l&rsquo;Epee, exulting, joyous, and confident of
      victory. I had come to confess everything to her, and by virtue of what I
      had done that confession was rendered easy. I could have said to her: &ldquo;The
      woman whom I wagered to win was not you, Roxalanne, but a certain
      Mademoiselle de Lavedan. Your love I have won, but that you may foster no
      doubts of my intentions, I have paid my wager and acknowledge defeat. I
      have made over to Chatellerault and to his heirs for all time my estates
      of Bardelys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, I had rehearsed it in my mind, and I was confident&mdash;I knew&mdash;that
      I should win her. And now&mdash;the disclosure of that shameful traffic
      coming from other lips than mine had ruined everything by forestalling my
      avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodenard should pay for it&mdash;by God, he should! Once again did I
      become a prey to the passion of anger which I have ever held to be
      unworthy in a gentleman, but to which it would seem that I was growing
      accustomed to give way. The ostler was mounting the steps at the moment.
      He carried in his hand a stout horsewhip with a long knotted thong.
      Hastily muttering a &ldquo;By your leave,&rdquo; I snatched it from him and sprang
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      My intendant was still talking of me. The room was crowded, for Rodenard
      alone had brought with him my twenty followers. One of these looked up as
      I brushed past him, and uttered a cry of surprise upon recognizing me. But
      Rodenard talked on, engrossed in his theme to the exclusion of all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Marquis,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;is a gentleman whom it is, indeed,
      an honour to serve&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A scream burst from him with the last word, for the lash of my whip had
      burnt a wheal upon his well-fed sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an honour that shall be yours no more, you dog!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leapt high into the air as my whip cut him again. He swung round, his
      face twisted with pain, his flabby cheeks white with fear, and his eyes
      wild with anger, for as yet the full force of the situation had not been
      borne in upon him. Then, seeing me there, and catching something of the
      awful passion that must have been stamped upon my face, he dropped on his
      knees and cried out something that I did not understand for I was past
      understanding much just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lash whistled through the air again and caught him about the
      shoulders. He writhed and roared in his anguish of both flesh and spirit.
      But I was pitiless. He had ruined my life for me with his talking, and, as
      God lived, he should pay the only price that it lay in his power to pay&mdash;the
      price of physical suffering. Again and again my whip hissed about his head
      and cut into his soft white flesh, whilst roaring for mercy he moved and
      rocked on his knees before me. Instinctively he approached me to hamper my
      movements, whilst I moved back to give my lash the better play. He held
      out his arms and joined his fat hands in supplication, but the lash caught
      them in its sinuous tormenting embrace, and started a red wheal across
      their whiteness. He tucked them into his armpits with a scream, and fell
      prone upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I remember that some of my men essayed to restrain me, which to my
      passion was as the wind to a blaze. I cracked my whip about their heads,
      commanding them to keep their distance lest they were minded to share his
      castigation. And so fearful an air must I have worn, that, daunted, they
      hung back and watched their leader&rsquo;s punishment in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think of it now, I take no little shame at the memory of how I beat
      him. It is, indeed, with deep reluctance and yet deeper shame that I have
      brought myself to write of it. If I offend you with this account of that
      horsewhipping, let necessity be my apology; for the horsewhipping itself I
      have, unfortunately, no apology, save the blind fury that obsessed me&mdash;which
      is no apology at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the morrow I repented me already with much bitterness. But in that
      hour I knew no reason. I was mad, and of my madness was born this harsh
      brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would talk of me and my affairs in a tavern, you hound!&rdquo; I cried, out
      of breath both by virtue of my passion and my exertions. &ldquo;Let the memory
      of this act as a curb upon your poisonous tongue in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Misericorde, monseigneur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, you shall have mercy&mdash;just so much mercy as you deserve. Have I
      trusted you all these years, and did my father trust you before me, for
      this? Have you grown sleek and fat and smug in my service that you should
      requite me thus? Sangdieu, Rodenard! My father had hanged you for the half
      of the talking that you have done this night. You dog! You miserable
      knave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he shrieked again, &ldquo;forgive! For your sainted mother&rsquo;s
      sake, forgive! Monseigneur, I did not know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are learning, cur; you are learning by the pain of your fat
      carcase; is it not so, carrion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sank down, his strength exhausted, a limp, moaning, bleeding mass of
      flesh, into which my whip still cut relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a picture in my mind of that ill-lighted room, of the startled
      faces on which the flickering glimmer of the candles shed odd shadows; of
      the humming and cracking of my whip; of my own voice raised in oaths and
      epithets of contempt; of Rodenard&rsquo;s screams; of the cries raised here and
      there in remonstrance or in entreaty, and of some more bold that called
      shame upon me. Then others took up that cry of &ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; so that at last I
      paused and stood there drawn up to my full height, as if in challenge.
      Towering above the heads of any in that room, I held my whip menacingly. I
      was unused to criticism, and their expressions of condemnation roused me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who questions my right?&rdquo; I demanded arrogantly, whereupon they one and
      all fell silent. &ldquo;If any here be bold enough to step out, he shall have my
      answer.&rdquo; Then, as none responded, I signified my contempt for them by a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; wailed Rodenard at my feet, his voice growing feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of answer, I gave him a final cut, then I flung the whip&mdash;
      which had grown ragged in the fray&mdash;back to the ostler from whom I
      had borrowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that suffice you, Rodenard,&rdquo; I said, touching him with my foot. &ldquo;See
      that I never set eyes upon you again, if you cherish your miserable life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that, monseigneur.&rdquo; groaned the wretch. &ldquo;Oh, not that! You have
      punished me; you have whipped me until I cannot stand; forgive me,
      monseigneur, forgive me now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgiven you, but I never wish to see you again, lest I should
      forget that I have forgiven you. Take him away, some of you,&rdquo; I bade my
      men, and in swift, silent obedience two of them stepped forward and bore
      the groaning, sobbing fellow from the room. When that was done &ldquo;Host,&rdquo; I
      commanded, &ldquo;prepare me a room. Attend me, a couple of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave orders thereafter for the disposal of my baggage, some of which my
      lacqueys brought up to the chamber that the landlord had in haste made
      ready for me. In that chamber I sat until very late; a prey to the utmost
      misery and despair. My rage being spent, I might have taken some thought
      for poor Ganymede and his condition, but my own affairs crowded
      over-heavily upon my mind, and sat the undisputed rulers of my thoughts
      that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one moment I considered journeying to Lavedan, only to dismiss the idea
      the next. What could it avail me now? Would Roxalanne believe the tale I
      had to tell? Would she not think, naturally enough, that I was but making
      the best of the situation, and that my avowal of the truth of a story
      which it was not in my power to deny was not spontaneous, but forced from
      me by circumstances? No, there was nothing more to be done. A score of
      amours had claimed my attention in the past and received it; yet there was
      not one of those affairs whose miscarriage would have afforded me the
      slightest concern or mortification. It seemed like an irony, like a Dies
      ire, that it should have been left to this first true passion of my life
      to have gone awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I slept ill when at last I sought my bed, and through the night I nursed
      my bitter grief, huddling to me the corpse of the love she had borne me as
      a mother may the corpse of her first-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow I resolved to leave Toulouse&mdash;to quit this province
      wherein so much had befallen me and repair to Beaugency, there to grow old
      in misanthropical seclusion. I had done with Courts, I had done with love
      and with women; I had done, it seemed to me, with life itself. Prodigal
      had it been in gifts that I had not sought of it. It had spread my table
      with the richest offerings, but they had been little to my palate, and I
      had nauseated quickly. And now, when here in this remote corner of France
      it had shown me the one prize I coveted, it had been swift to place it
      beyond my reach, thereby sowing everlasting discontent and misery in my
      hitherto pampered heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw Castelroux that day, but I said no word to him of my affliction. He
      brought me news of Chatellerault. The Count was lying in a dangerous
      condition at the Auberge Royale, and might not be moved. The physician
      attending him all but despaired of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is asking to see you,&rdquo; said Castelroux.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was not minded to respond. For all that he had deeply wronged me,
      for all that I despised him very cordially, the sight of him in his
      present condition might arouse my pity, and I was in no mood to waste upon
      such a one as Chatellerault even on his deathbed&mdash;a quality of which
      I had so dire a need just then for my own case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not go,&rdquo; said I, after deliberation. &ldquo;Tell him from me that I
      forgive him freely if it be that he seeks my forgiveness; tell him that I
      bear him no rancour, and&mdash;that he had better make his will, to save
      me trouble hereafter, if he should chance to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said this because I had no mind, if he should perish intestate, to go in
      quest of his next heirs and advise them that my late Picardy estates were
      now their property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castelroux sought yet to persuade me to visit the Count, but I held firmly
      to my resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving Toulouse to-day,&rdquo; I announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither do you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hell, or to Beaugency&mdash;I scarce know which, nor does it matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me in surprise, but, being a man of breeding, asked no
      questions upon matters that he accounted secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the King?&rdquo; he ventured presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty has already dispensed me from my duties by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I did not go that day. I maintained the intention until
      sunset; then, seeing that it was too late, I postponed my departure until
      the morrow. I can assign no reason for my dallying mood. Perhaps it sprang
      from the inertness that pervaded me, perhaps some mysterious hand detained
      me. Be that as it may, that I remained another night at the Hotel de
      l&rsquo;Epee was one of those contingencies which, though slight and seemingly
      inconsequential in themselves, lead to great issues. Had I departed that
      day for Beaugency, it is likely that you had never heard of me&mdash;leastways,
      not from my own pen&mdash;for in what so far I have told you, without that
      which is to follow, there is haply little that was worth the labour of
      setting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, then, I set out; but having started late, we got no
      farther than Grenade, where we lay the night once more at the Hotel de la
      Couronne. And so, through having delayed my departure by a single day, did
      it come to pass that a message reached me before it might have been too
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was high noon of the morrow. Our horses stood saddled; indeed, some of
      my men were already mounted&mdash;for I was not minded to disband them
      until Beaugency was reached&mdash;and my two coaches were both ready for
      the journey. The habits of a lifetime are not so easy to abandon even when
      Necessity raises her compelling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in the act of settling my score with the landlord when of a sudden
      there were quick steps in the passage, the clank of a rapier against the
      wall, and a voice&mdash;the voice of Castelroux&mdash;calling excitedly
      &ldquo;Bardelys! Monsieur de Bardelys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; I cried in greeting, as he stepped into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you still for Beaugency?&rdquo; he asked sharply, throwing back his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; I answered, wondering at this excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have seen nothing of Saint-Eustache and his men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet they must have passed this way not many hours ago.&rdquo; Then tossing his
      hat on the table and speaking with sudden vehemence: &ldquo;If you have any
      interest in the family of Lavedan, you will return upon the instant to
      Toulouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mention of Lavedan was enough to quicken my pulses. Yet in the past
      two days I had mastered resignation, and in doing that we school ourselves
      to much restraint. I turned slowly, and surveyed the little Captain
      attentively. His black eyes sparkled, and his moustaches bristled with
      excitement. Clearly he had news of import. I turned to the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave us, Monsieur l&rsquo;Hote,&rdquo; said I shortly; and when he had departed,
      &ldquo;What of the Lavedan family, Castelroux?&rdquo; I inquired as calmly as I might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Chevalier de Saint-Eustache left Toulouse at six o&rsquo;clock this morning
      for Lavedan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swift the suspicion of his errand broke upon my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has betrayed the Vicomte?&rdquo; I half inquired, half asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Castelroux nodded. &ldquo;He has obtained a warrant for his apprehension from
      the Keeper of the Seals, and is gone to execute it. In the course of a few
      days Lavedan will be in danger of being no more than a name. This
      Saint-Eustache is driving a brisk trade, by God, and some fine prizes have
      already fallen to his lot. But if you add them all together, they are not
      likely to yield as much as this his latest expedition. Unless you
      intervene, Bardelys, the Vicomte de Lavedan is doomed and his family
      houseless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will intervene,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;By God, I will! And as for Saint-Eustache&mdash;he
      was born under a propitious star, indeed, if he escapes the gallows. He
      little dreams that I am still to be reckoned with. There, Castelroux, I
      will start for Lavedan at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already I was striding to the door, when the Gascon called me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good will that do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Were it not better first to return to
      Toulouse and obtain a counter-warrant from the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was wisdom in his words&mdash;much wisdom. But my blood was afire,
      and I was in too hot a haste to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to Toulouse?&rdquo; I echoed scornfully. &ldquo;A waste of time, Captain. No,
      I will go straight to Lavedan. I need no counter-warrant. I know too much
      of this Chevalier&rsquo;s affairs, and my very presence should be enough to stay
      his hand. He is as foul a traitor as you&rsquo;ll find in France; but for the
      moment God bless him for a very opportune knave. Gilles!&rdquo; I called,
      throwing wide the door. &ldquo;Gilles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he answered, hastening to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put back the carriages and saddle me a horse,&rdquo; I commanded. &ldquo;And bid your
      fellows mount at once and await me in the courtyard. We are not going to
      Beaugency, Gilles. We ride north&mdash;to Lavedan.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII. SAINT-EUSTACHE IS OBSTINATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the occasion of my first visit to Lavedan I had disregarded&mdash;or,
      rather, Fate had contrived that I should disregard&mdash;Chatellerault&rsquo;s
      suggestion that I should go with all the panoply of power&mdash;with my
      followers, my liveries, and my equipages to compose the magnificence all
      France had come to associate with my name, and thus dazzle by my brilliant
      lustre the lady I was come to win. As you may remember, I had crept into
      the chateau like a thief in the night,&mdash;wounded, bedraggled, and of
      miserable aspect, seeking to provoke compassion rather than admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so now that I made my second visit. I availed myself of all the
      splendour to which I owed my title of &ldquo;Magnificent,&rdquo; and rode into the
      courtyard of the Chateau de Lavedan preceded by twenty well-mounted knaves
      wearing the gorgeous Saint-Pol liveries of scarlet and gold, with the
      Bardelys escutcheon broidered on the breasts of their doublets&mdash;on a
      field or a bar azure surcharged by three lilies of the field. They were
      armed with swords and musketoons, and had more the air of a royal
      bodyguard than of a company of attendant servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our coming was in a way well timed. I doubt if we could have stayed the
      execution of Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s warrant even had we arrived earlier. But for
      effect&mdash;to produce a striking coup de theatre&mdash;we could not have
      come more opportunely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coach stood in the quadrangle, at the foot of the chateau steps: down
      these the Vicomte was descending, with the Vicomtesse&mdash;grim and
      blasphemant as ever, on one side, and his daughter, white of face and with
      tightly compressed lips, on the other. Between these two women&mdash;his
      wife and his child&mdash;as different in body as they were different in
      soul, came Lavedan with a firm step, a good colour, and a look of
      well-bred, lofty indifference to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He disposed himself to enter the carriage which was to bear him to prison
      with much the same air he would have assumed had his destination been a
      royal levee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the coach were grouped a score of men of Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s company&mdash;half
      soldiers, half ploughboys&mdash;ill-garbed and indifferently accoutred in
      dull breastplates and steel caps, many of which were rusted. By the
      carriage door stood the long, lank figure of the Chevalier himself,
      dressed with his wonted care, and perfumed, curled, and beribboned beyond
      belief. His weak, boyish face sought by scowls and by the adoption of a
      grim smile to assume an air of martial ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the grouping in the quadrangle when my men, with Gilles at their
      head, thundered across the drawbridge, giving pause to those within, and
      drawing upon themselves the eyes of all, as they rode, two by two, under
      the old-world arch of the keep into the courtyard. And Gilles, who knew
      our errand, and who was as ready-witted a rogue as ever rode with me, took
      in the situation at a glance. Knowing how much I desired to make a goodly
      show, he whispered an order. This resulted in the couples dividing at the
      gateway, one going to the left and one to the right, so that as they came
      they spread themselves in a crescent, and drawing rein, they faced
      forward, confronting and half surrounding the Chevalier&rsquo;s company.
    </p>
    <p>
      As each couple appeared, the curiosity&mdash;the uneasiness, probably&mdash;of
      Saint-Eustache and his men, had increased, and their expectancy was on
      tiptoe to see what lord it was went abroad with such regal pomp, when I
      appeared in the gateway and advanced at the trot into the middle of the
      quadrangle. There I drew rein and doffed my hat to them as they stood,
      open-mouthed and gaping one and all. If it was a theatrical display, a
      parade worthy of a tilt-ground, it was yet a noble and imposing advent,
      and their gaping told me that it was not without effect. The men looked
      uneasily at the Chevalier; the Chevalier looked uneasily at his men;
      mademoiselle, very pale, lowered her eyes and pressed her lips yet more
      tightly; the Vicomtesse uttered an oath of astonishment; whilst Lavedan,
      too dignified to manifest surprise, greeted me with a sober bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind them on the steps I caught sight of a group of domestics, old
      Anatole standing slightly in advance of his fellows, and wondering, no
      doubt, whether this were, indeed, the bedraggled Lesperon of a little
      while ago&mdash;for if I had thought of pomp in the display of my
      lacqueys, no less had I considered it in the decking of my own person.
      Without any of the ribbons and fopperies that mark the coxcomb, yet was I
      clad, plumed, and armed with a magnificence such as I&rsquo;ll swear had not
      been seen within the grey walls of that old castle in the lifetime of any
      of those that were now present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilles leapt from his horse as I drew rein, and hastened to hold my
      stirrup, with a murmured &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; which title drew a fresh astonishment
      into the eyes of the beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advanced leisurely towards Saint-Eustache, and addressed him with such
      condescension as I might a groom, to impress and quell a man of this type
      your best weapon is the arrogance that a nobler spirit would resent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A world of odd meetings this, Saint-Eustache,&rdquo; I smiled disdainfully. &ldquo;A
      world of strange comings and goings, and of strange transformations. The
      last time we were here we stood mutually as guests of Monsieur le Vicomte;
      at present you appear to be officiating as a&mdash;a tipstaff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; He coloured, and he uttered the word in accents of awakening
      resentment. I looked into his eyes, coldly, impassively, as if waiting to
      hear what he might have to add, and so I stayed until his glance fell and
      his spirit was frozen in him. He knew me, and he knew how much I was to be
      feared. A word from me to the King might send him to the wheel. It was
      upon this I played. Presently, as his eye fell, &ldquo;Is your business with me,
      Monsieur de Bardelys?&rdquo; he asked, and at that utterance of my name there
      was a commotion on the steps, whilst the Vicomte started, and his eyes
      frowned upon me, and the Vicomtesse looked up suddenly to scan me with a
      fresh interest. She beheld at last in the flesh the gentleman who had
      played so notorious a part, ten years ago, in that scandal connected with
      the Duchesse de Bourgogne, of which she never tired of reciting the
      details. And think that she had sat at table with him day by day and been
      unconscious of that momentous fact! Such, I make no doubt, was what passed
      through her mind at the moment, and, to judge from her expression, I
      should say that the excitement of beholding the Magnificent Bardelys had
      for the nonce eclipsed beholding even her husband&rsquo;s condition and the
      imminent sequestration of Lavedan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is with you, Chevalier,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It relates to your mission
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His jaw fell. &ldquo;You wish&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To desire you to withdraw your men and quit Lavedan at once, abandoning
      the execution of your warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flashed me a look of impotent hate. &ldquo;You know of the existence of my
      warrant, Monsieur de Bardelys, and you must therefore realize that a royal
      mandate alone can exempt me from delivering Monsieur de Lavedan to the
      Keeper of the Seals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only warrant,&rdquo; I answered, somewhat baffled, but far from abandoning
      hope, &ldquo;is my word. You shall say to the Garde des Sceaux that you have
      done this upon the authority of the Marquis de Bardelys, and you have my
      promise that His Majesty shall confirm my action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In saying that I said too much, as I was quickly to realize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty will confirm it, monsieur?&rdquo; he said interrogatively, and he
      shook his head. &ldquo;That is a risk I dare not run. My warrant sets me under
      imperative obligations which I must discharge&mdash;you will see the
      justice of what I state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was all humility, all subservience, nevertheless it was firm to
      the point of being hard. But my last card, the card upon which I was
      depending, was yet to be played.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the honour to step aside with me, Chevalier?&rdquo; I commanded
      rather than besought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service, sir,&rdquo; said he; and I drew him out of earshot of those
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Saint-Eustache, we can talk,&rdquo; said I, with an abrupt change of
      manner from the coldly arrogant to the coldly menacing. &ldquo;I marvel greatly
      at your temerity in pursuing this Iscariot business after learning who I
      am, at Toulouse two nights ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clenched his hands, and his weak face hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would beg you to consider your expressions, monsieur, and to control
      them,&rdquo; said he in a thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I vouchsafed him a stare of freezing amazement. &ldquo;You will no doubt remember
      in what capacity I find you employed. Nay, keep your hands still,
      Saint-Eustache. I don&rsquo;t fight catchpolls, and if you give me trouble my
      men are yonder.&rdquo; And I jerked my thumb over my shoulder. &ldquo;And now to
      business. I am not minded to talk all day. I was saying that I marvel at
      your temerity, and more particularly at your having laid information
      against Monsieur de Lavedan, and having come here to arrest him, knowing,
      as you must know, that I am interested in the Vicomte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of that interest, monsieur,&rdquo; said he, with a sneer for which
      I could have struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This act of yours,&rdquo; I pursued, ignoring his interpolation, &ldquo;savours very
      much of flying in the face of Destiny. It almost seems to me as if you
      were defying me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lip trembled, and his eyes shunned my glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;indeed, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; he was protesting, when I cut him
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be so great a fool but that you must realize that if I tell
      the King what I know of you, you will be stripped of your ill-gotten
      gains, and broken on the wheel for a double traitor&mdash;a betrayer of
      your fellow-rebels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not do that, monsieur?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It would be unworthy in
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that I laughed in his face. &ldquo;Heart of God! Are you to be what you
      please, and do you still expect that men shall be nice in dealing with
      you? I would do this thing, and, by my faith, Monsieur de Eustache, I will
      do it, if you compel me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reddened and moved his foot uneasily. Perhaps I did not take the best
      way with him, after all. I might have confined myself to sowing fear in
      his heart; that alone might have had the effect I desired; by visiting
      upon him at the same time the insults I could not repress, I may have
      aroused his resistance, and excited his desire above all else to thwart
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; he demanded, with a sudden arrogance which
      almost cast mine into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said I, deeming the time ripe to make a plain tale of it,
      &ldquo;to withdraw your men, and to ride back to Toulouse without Monsieur de
      Lavedan, there to confess to the Keeper of the Seals that your suspicions
      were unfounded, and that you have culled evidence that the Vicomte has had
      no relations with Monsieur the King&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me in amazement&mdash;amusedly, almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A likely story that to bear to the astute gentlemen in Toulouse,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, ma foi, a most likely story,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;When they come to consider
      the profit that you are losing by not apprehending the Vicomte, and can
      think of none that you are making, they will have little difficulty in
      believing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of this evidence you refer to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, I take it, discovered no incriminating evidence&mdash;no
      documents that will tell against the Vicomte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur, it is true that I have not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and bit his lip, my smile making him aware of his indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, you must invent some evidence to prove that he was in no
      way, associated with the rebellion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Bardelys,&rdquo; said he very insolently, &ldquo;we waste time in idle
      words. If you think that I will imperil my neck for the sake of serving
      you or the Vicomte, you are most prodigiously at fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never thought so. But I have thought that you might be induced to
      imperil your neck&mdash;as you have it&mdash;for its own sake, and to the
      end that you might save it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved away. &ldquo;Monsieur, you talk in vain. You have no royal warrant to
      supersede mine. Do what you will when you come to Toulouse,&rdquo; and he smiled
      darkly. &ldquo;Meanwhile, the Vicomte goes with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no evidence against him!&rdquo; I cried, scarce believing that he
      would dare to defy me and that I had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the evidence of my word. I am ready to swear to what I know&mdash;that,
      whilst I was here at Lavedan, some weeks ago, I discovered his connection
      with the rebels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what think you, miserable fool, shall your word weigh against mine?&rdquo;
       I cried. &ldquo;Never fear, Monsieur le Chevalier, I shall be in Toulouse to
      give you the lie by showing that your word is a word to which no man may
      attach faith, and by exposing to the King your past conduct. If you think
      that, after I have spoken, King Louis whom they name the just will suffer
      the trial of the Vicomte to go further on your instigation, or if you
      think that you will be able to slip your own neck from the noose I shall
      have set about it, you are an infinitely greater fool than I deem you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood and looked at me over his shoulder, his face crimson, and his
      brows black as a thundercloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this may betide when you come to Toulouse, Monsieur de Bardelys,&rdquo;
       said he darkly, &ldquo;but from here to Toulouse it is a matter of some twenty
      leagues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, he turned on his heel and left me, baffled and angry, to puzzle
      out the inner meaning of his parting words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave his men the order to mount, and bade Monsieur de Lavedan enter the
      coach, whereupon Gilles shot me a glance of inquiry. For a second, as I
      stepped slowly after the Chevalier, I was minded to try armed resistance,
      and to convert that grey courtyard into a shambles. Then I saw betimes the
      futility of such a step, and I shrugged my shoulders in answer to my
      servant&rsquo;s glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have spoken to the Vicomte ere he departed, but I was too deeply
      chagrined and humiliated by my defeat. So much so that I had no room in my
      thoughts even for the very natural conjecture of what Lavedan must be
      thinking of me. I repented me then of my rashness in coming to Lavedan
      without having seen the King&mdash;as Castelroux had counselled me. I had
      come indulging vain dreams of a splendid overthrow of Saint-Eustache. I
      had thought to shine heroically in Mademoiselle&rsquo;s eyes, and thus I had
      hoped that both gratitude for having saved her father and admiration at
      the manner in which I had achieved it would predispose her to grant me a
      hearing in which I might plead my rehabilitation. Once that were accorded
      me, I did not doubt I should prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now my dream was all dispelled, and my pride had suffered just such a
      humiliating fall as the moralists tell us pride must ever suffer. There
      seemed little left me but to go hence with lambent tail, like a dog that
      has been whipped&mdash;my dazzling escort become a mockery but that it
      served the more loudly to advertise my true impotency.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I approached the carriage, the Vicomtesse swept suddenly down the steps
      and came towards me with a friendly smile. &ldquo;Monsieur de Bardelys,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;we are grateful for your intervention in the cause of that rebel my
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; I besought her, under my breath, &ldquo;if you would not totally
      destroy him, I beseech you to be cautious. By your leave, I will have my
      men refreshed, and thereafter I shall take the road to Toulouse again. I
      can only hope that my intervention with the King may bear better fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although I spoke in a subdued key, Saint-Eustache, who stood near us,
      overheard me, as his face very clearly testified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain here, sir,&rdquo; she replied, with some effusion, &ldquo;and follow us when
      you are rested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow you?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;Do you then go with Monsieur de Lavedan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Anne,&rdquo; said the Vicomte politely from the carriage. &ldquo;It will be
      tiring you unnecessarily. You were better advised to remain here until my
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I doubt not that the poor Vicomte was more concerned with how she would
      tire him than with how the journey might tire her. But the Vicomtesse was
      not to be gainsaid. The Chevalier had sneered when the Vicomte spoke of
      returning. Madame had caught that sneer, and she swung round upon him now
      with the vehement fury of a virago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not return, you think, you Judas!&rdquo; she snarled at him, her lean,
      swarthy face growing very evil to see. &ldquo;But he shall&mdash;by God, he
      shall! And look to your skin when he does, monsieur the catchpoll, for, on
      my honour, you shall have a foretaste of hell for your trouble in this
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier smiled with much restraint. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s tongue,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;does no injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will a woman&rsquo;s arm, think you?&rdquo; demanded that warlike matron. &ldquo;You
      musk-stinking tipstaff, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne, my love,&rdquo; implored the Vicomte soothingly, &ldquo;I beg that you will
      control yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I submit to the insolence of this misbegotten vassal? Shall I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember rather that it does not become the dignity of your station to
      address the fellow. We avoid venomous reptiles, but we do not pause to
      reproach them with their venom. God made them so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Eustache coloured to the roots of his hair, then, turning hastily to
      the driver, he bade him start. He would have closed the door with that,
      but that madame thrust herself forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the Chevalier&rsquo;s chance to be avenged. &ldquo;You cannot go,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot?&rdquo; Her cheeks reddened. &ldquo;Why not, monsieur Lesperon?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no reasons to afford you,&rdquo; he answered brutally. &ldquo;You cannot go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, Chevalier,&rdquo; I interposed. &ldquo;You go beyond your rights in
      seeking to prevent her. Monsieur le Vicomte is not yet convicted. Do not,
      I beseech you, transcend the already odious character of your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without more ado I shouldered him aside, and held the door that she
      might enter. She rewarded me with a smile&mdash;half vicious, half
      whimsical, and mounted the step. Saint-Eustache would have interfered. He
      came at me as if resenting that shoulder-thrust of mine, and for a second
      I almost thought he would have committed the madness of striking me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, Saint-Eustache,&rdquo; I said very quietly, my eyes fixed on his.
      And much as dead Caesar&rsquo;s ghost may have threatened Brutus with Philippi
      &ldquo;We meet at Toulouse, Chevalier,&rdquo; said I, and closing the carriage door I
      stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a flutter of skirts behind me. It was mademoiselle. So brave and
      outwardly so calm until now, the moment of actual separation&mdash;and
      added thereunto perhaps her mother&rsquo;s going and the loneliness that for
      herself she foresaw&mdash;proved more than she could endure. I stepped
      aside, and she swept past me and caught at the leather curtain of the
      coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some things that a man of breeding may not witness&mdash;some
      things to look upon which is near akin to eavesdropping or reading the
      letters of another. Such a scene did I now account the present one, and,
      turning, I moved away. But Saint-Eustache cut it short, for scarce had I
      taken three paces when his voice rang out the command to move. The driver
      hesitated, for the girl was still hanging at the window. But a second
      command, accompanied by a vigorous oath, overcame his hesitation. He
      gathered up his reins, cracked his whip, and the lumbering wheels began to
      move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care, child!&rdquo; I heard the Vicomte cry, &ldquo;have a care! Adieu, mon
      enfant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang back, sobbing, and assuredly she would have fallen, thrown out
      of balance by the movement of the coach, but that I put forth my hands and
      caught her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think she knew whose were the arms that held her for that brief
      space, so desolated was she by the grief so long repressed. At last she
      realized that it was this worthless Bardelys against whom she rested; this
      man who had wagered that he would win and wed her; this impostor who had
      come to her under an assumed name; this knave who had lied to her as no
      gentleman could have lied, swearing to love her, whilst, in reality, he
      did no more than seek to win a wager. When all this she realized, she
      shuddered a second, then moved abruptly from my grasp, and, without so
      much as a glance at me, she left me, and, ascending the steps of the
      chateau, she passed from my sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave the order to dismount as the last of Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s followers
      vanished under the portcullis.

      CHAPTER XIX. THE FLINT AND THE STEEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle will see you, monsieur,&rdquo; said Anatole at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice already had he carried unavailingly my request that Roxalanne should
      accord me an interview ere I departed. On this the third occasion I had
      bidden him say that I would not stir from Lavedan until she had done me
      the honour of hearing me. Seemingly that threat had prevailed where
      entreaties had been scorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed Anatole from the half-light of the hall in which I had been
      pacing into the salon overlooking the terraces and the river, where
      Roxalanne awaited me. She was standing at the farther end of the room by
      one of the long windows, which was open, for, although we were already in
      the first week of October, the air of Languedoc was as warm and balmy as
      that of Paris or Picardy is in summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advanced to the centre of the chamber, and there I paused and waited
      until it should please her to acknowledge my presence and turn to face me.
      I was no fledgling. I had seen much, I had learnt much and been in many
      places, and my bearing was wont to convey it. Never in my life had I been
      gauche, for which I thank my parents, and if years ago&mdash;long years
      ago&mdash;a certain timidity had marked my first introductions to the
      Louvre and the Luxembourg, that timidity was something from which I had
      long since parted company. And yet it seemed to me, as I stood in that
      pretty, sunlit room awaiting the pleasure of that child, scarce out of her
      teens, that some of the awkwardness I had escaped in earlier years, some
      of the timidity of long ago, came to me then. I shifted the weight of my
      body from one leg to the other; I fingered the table by which I stood; I
      pulled at the hat I held; my colour came and went; I looked at her
      furtively from under bent brows, and I thanked God that her back being
      towards me she might not see the clown I must have seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, unable longer to brook that discomposing silence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle!&rdquo; I called softly. The sound of my own voice seemed to
      invigorate me, to strip me of my awkwardness and self-consciousness. It
      broke the spell that for a moment had been over me, and brought me back to
      myself&mdash;to the vain, self-confident, flamboyant Bardelys that perhaps
      you have pictured from my writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered, without turning, &ldquo;that what you may have
      to say may justify in some measure your very importunate insistence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On my life, this was not encouraging. But now that I was master of myself,
      I was not again so easily to be disconcerted. My eyes rested upon her as
      she stood almost framed in the opening of that long window. How straight
      and supple she was, yet how dainty and slight withal! She was far from
      being a tall woman, but her clean length of limb, her very slightness, and
      the high-bred poise of her shapely head, conveyed an illusion of height
      unless you stood beside her. The illusion did not sway me then. I saw only
      a child; but a child with a great spirit, with a great soul that seemed to
      accentuate her physical helplessness. That helplessness, which I felt
      rather than saw, wove into the warp of my love. She was in grief just then&mdash;in
      grief at the arrest of her father, and at the dark fate that threatened
      him; in grief at the unworthiness of a lover. Of the two which might be
      the more bitter it was not mine to judge, but I burned to gather her to
      me, to comfort and cherish her, to make her one with me, and thus, whilst
      giving her something of my man&rsquo;s height and strength, cull from her
      something of that pure, noble spirit, and thus sanctify my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a moment&rsquo;s weakness when she spoke. I was within an ace of advancing
      and casting myself upon my knees like any Lenten penitent, to sue
      forgiveness. But I set the inclination down betimes. Such expedients would
      not avail me here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have to say, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I answered after a pause, &ldquo;would
      justify a saint descending into, hell; or, rather, to make my metaphor
      more apt, would warrant a sinner&rsquo;s intrusion into heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke solemnly, yet not too solemnly; the least slur of a sardonic
      humour was in my tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved her head upon the white column of her neck, and with the gesture
      one of her brown curls became disordered. I could fancy the upward tilt of
      her delicate nose, the scornful curve of her lip as she answered shortly
      &ldquo;Then say it quickly, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, being thus bidden, I said quickly &ldquo;I love you, Roxalanne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heel beat the shimmering parquet of the floor; she half turned towards
      me, her cheek flushed, her lip tremulous with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say what you have to say, monsieur?&rdquo; she demanded in a
      concentrated voice, &ldquo;and having said it, will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I have already said it,&rdquo; I answered, with a wistful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped. Then suddenly facing round upon me, a world of anger in
      her blue eyes&mdash;eyes that I had known dreamy, but which were now very
      wide awake. &ldquo;Was it to offer me this last insult you forced your presence
      upon me? Was it to mock me with those words, me&mdash;a woman, with no man
      about me to punish you? Shame, sir! Yet it is no more than I might look
      for in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you do me grievous wrong&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do you no wrong,&rdquo; she answered hotly, then stopped, unwilling haply to
      be drawn into contention with me. &ldquo;Enfin, since you have said what you
      came to say will you go?&rdquo; And she pointed to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo; I began in a voice of earnest
      intercession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she interrupted angrily, and for a second the violence of her voice
      and gesture almost reminded me of the Vicomtesse. &ldquo;I will hear no more
      from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you shall,&rdquo; I answered no whit less firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen to you. Talk if you will. You shall have the walls for
      audience.&rdquo; And she moved towards the door, but I barred her passage. I was
      courteous to the last degree; I bowed low before her as I put myself in
      her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all that was wanting&mdash;that you should offer me violence!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, when you have heard me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to hear you. Nothing that you may say can matter to me. Oh,
      monsieur, if you have any instincts of gentility, if you have any
      pretension to be accounted anything but a mauvais sujet, I beg of you to
      respect my grief. You witnessed, yourself, the arrest of my father. This
      is no season for such as scene as you are creating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon! It is in such a season as this that you need the comfort and
      support that the man you love alone can give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man I love?&rdquo; she echoed, and from flushed that they had been, her
      cheeks went very pale. Her eyes fell for an instant, then&mdash;they were
      raised again, and their blue depths were offered me. &ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; she
      said, through her teeth, &ldquo;that your insolence transcends all belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you deny it?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Can you deny that you love me? If you can&mdash;why,
      then, you lied to me three nights ago at Toulouse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That smote her hard&mdash;so hard that she forgot her assurance that she
      would not listen to me&mdash;her promise to herself that she would stoop
      to no contention with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, in a momentary weakness, in my nescience of you as you truly are, I
      did make some such admission, I did entertain such feelings for you,
      things have come to my knowledge since then, monsieur, that have revealed
      you to me as another man; I have learnt something that has utterly
      withered such love as I then confessed. Now, monsieur, are you satisfied,
      and will you let me pass?&rdquo; She said the last words with a return of her
      imperiousness, already angry at having been drawn so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I answered brutally, &ldquo;that you did not
      speak the truth three nights ago. You never loved me. It was pity that
      deluded you, shame that urged you&mdash;shame at the Delilah part you had
      played and at your betrayal of me. Now, mademoiselle, you may pass,&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I stood aside, assured that as she was a woman she would not pass me
      now. Nor did she. She recoiled a step instead. Her lip quivered. Then she
      recovered quickly. Her mother might have told her that she was a fool for
      engaging herself in such a duel with me&mdash;me, the veteran of a hundred
      amorous combats. Yet though I doubt not it was her first assault-at-arms
      of this description, she was more than a match for me, as her next words
      proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, I thank you for enlightening me. I cannot, indeed, have spoken
      the truth three nights ago. You are right, I do not doubt it now, and you
      lift from me a load of shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dieu! It was like a thrust in the high lines, and its hurtful violence
      staggered me. I was finished, it seemed. The victory was hers, and she but
      a child with no practice of Cupid&rsquo;s art of fence!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, monsieur,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;now that you are satisfied that you did wrong
      to say I loved you, now that we have disposed of that question&mdash;adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A moment yet!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;We have disposed of that, but there was another
      point, an earlier one, which for the moment we have disregarded. We have&mdash;you
      have disproved the love I was so presumptuous as to believe you fostered
      for me. We have yet to reckon with the love I bear you, mademoiselle, and
      of that we shall not be able to dispose so readily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a gesture of weariness or of impatience, she turned aside. &ldquo;What is
      it you want? What do you seek to gain by thus provoking me? To win your
      wager?&rdquo; Her voice was cold. Who to have looked upon that childlike face,
      upon those meek, pondering eyes, could have believed her capable of so
      much cruelty?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can no longer be any question of my wager; I have lost and paid
      it,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up suddenly. Her brows met in a frown of bewilderment. Clearly
      this interested her. Again was she drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You have lost and paid it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so. That odious, cursed, infamous wager, was the something which I
      hinted at so often as standing between you and me. The confession that so
      often I was on the point of making&mdash;that so often you urged me to
      make&mdash;concerned that wager. Would to God, Roxalanne, that I had told
      you!&rdquo; I cried, and it seemed to me that the sincerity ringing in my voice
      drove some of the harshness from her countenance, some of the coldness
      from her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;it always seemed to me either not yet time,
      or already too late. Yet so soon as I regained my liberty, my first
      thought was of that. While the wager existed I might not ask you to become
      my wife, lest I should seem to be carrying out the original intention
      which embarked me upon the business of wooing you, and brought me here to
      Languedoc. And so my first step was to seek out Chatellerault and deliver
      him my note of hand for my Picardy possessions, the bulk&mdash;by far the
      greater bulk&mdash;of all my fortune. My second step was to repair to you
      at the Hotel de l&rsquo;Epee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last I could approach you with clean hands; I could confess what I had
      done; and since it seemed to me that I had made the utmost atonement, I
      was confident of success. Alas! I came too late. In the porch of the
      auberge I met you as you came forth. From my talkative intendant you had
      learnt already the story of that bargain into which Bardelys had entered.
      You had learnt who I was, and you thought that you had learnt why I wooed
      you. Accordingly you could but despise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had sunk into a chair. Her hands were folded in a listless manner in
      her lap, and her eyes were lowered, her cheeks pale. But the swift heave
      of her bosom told me that my words were not without effect. &ldquo;Do you know
      nothing of the bargain that I made with Chatellerault?&rdquo; she asked in a
      voice that held, I thought, some trace of misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatellerault was a cheat!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;No man of honour in France would
      have accounted himself under obligation to pay that wager. I paid it, not
      because I thought the payment due, but that by its payment I might offer
      you a culminating proof of my sincerity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I passed him my word to&mdash;to marry
      him, if he set you at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The promise does not hold, for when you made it I was at liberty already.
      Besides, Chatellerault is dead by now&mdash;or very near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; she echoed, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dead. We fought&mdash;&rdquo; The ghost of a smile, of sudden, of scornful
      understanding, passed like a ray of light across her face. &ldquo;Pardieu!&rdquo; I
      cried, &ldquo;you do me a wrong there. It was not by my hands that he fell. It
      was not by me that the duel was instigated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that I gave her the whole details of the affair, including the
      information that Chatellerault had been no party to my release, and that
      for his attempted judicial murder of me the King would have dealt very
      hardly with him had he not saved the King the trouble by throwing himself
      upon his sword:
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence when I had done. Roxalanne sat on, and seemed to
      ponder. To let all that I had said sink in and advocate my cause, as to me
      was very clear it must, I turned aside and moved to one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not tell me before?&rdquo; she asked suddenly. &ldquo;Why&mdash;oh, why&mdash;did
      you not confess to me the whole infamous affair as soon as you came to
      love me, as you say you did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I say I did?&rdquo; I repeated after her. &ldquo;Do you doubt it? Can you doubt it
      in the face of what I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what to believe!&rdquo; she cried, a sob in her voice. &ldquo;You
      have deceived me so far, so often. Why did you not tell me that night on
      the river? Or later, when I pressed you in this very house? Or again, the
      other night in the prison of Toulouse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask me why. Can you not answer the question for yourself? Can you not
      conceive the fear that was in me that you should shrink away from me in
      loathing? The fear that if you cared a little, I might for all time stifle
      such affection as you bore me? The fear that I must ruin your trust in me?
      Oh, mademoiselle, can you not see how my only hope lay in first owning
      defeat to Chatellerault, in first paying the wager?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you have lent yourself to such a bargain?&rdquo; was her next
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, indeed?&rdquo; I asked in my turn. &ldquo;From your mother you have heard
      something of the reputation that attaches to Bardelys. I was a man of
      careless ways, satiated with all the splendours life could give me,
      nauseated by all its luxuries. Was it wonderful that I allowed myself to
      be lured into this affair? It promised some excitement, a certain novelty,
      difficulties in a path that I had&mdash;alas!&mdash;ever found all too
      smooth&mdash;for Chatellerault had made your reputed coldness the chief
      bolster of his opinion that I should not win.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, I was not given to over-nice scruples. I make no secret of my
      infirmities, but do not blame me too much. If you could see the fine
      demoiselles we have in Paris, if you could listen to their tenets and take
      a deep look into their lives, you would not marvel at me. I had never
      known any but these. On the night of my coming to Lavedan, your sweetness,
      your pure innocence, your almost childish virtue, dazed me by their
      novelty. From that first moment I became your slave. Then I was in your
      garden day by day. And here, in this old Languedoc garden with you and
      your roses, during the languorous days of my convalescence, is it
      wonderful that some of the purity, some of the sweetness that was of you
      and of your roses, should have crept into my heart and cleansed it a
      little? Ah, mademoiselle!&rdquo; I cried&mdash;and, coming close to her, I would
      have bent my knee in intercession but that she restrained me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo;we harass ourselves in vain. This can have
      but one ending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tones were cold, but the coldness I knew was forced&mdash;else had she
      not said &ldquo;we harass ourselves.&rdquo; Instead of quelling my ardour, it gave it
      fuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I cried, almost exultantly. &ldquo;It can end but one
      way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught my meaning, and her frown deepened. I went too fast, it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had better end now, monsieur. There is too much between us. You
      wagered to win me to wife.&rdquo; She shuddered. &ldquo;I could never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; I denied stoutly, &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; She caught her breath. &ldquo;You did not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I pursued boldly. &ldquo;I did not wager to win you. I wagered to win a
      certain Mademoiselle de Lavedan, who was unknown to me&mdash;but not you,
      not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, with never so slight a touch of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your distinctions are very fine&mdash;too fine for me, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you to be reasonable. Think reasonably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not reasonable? Do I not think? But there is so much to think of!&rdquo;
       she sighed. &ldquo;You carried your deception so far. You came here, for
      instance, as Monsieur de Lesperon. Why that duplicity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, mademoiselle, I did not,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at me with pathetic disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, indeed, monsieur, you deny things very bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I tell you that my name was Lesperon? Did I present myself to
      monsieur your father as Lesperon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely no; a thousand times no. I was the victim of circumstances in
      that, and if I turned them to my own account after they had been forced
      upon me, shall I be blamed and accounted a cheat? Whilst I was
      unconscious, your father, seeking for a clue to my identity, made an
      inspection of my clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the pocket of my doublet they found some papers addressed to Rene de
      Lesperon&mdash;some love letters, a communication from the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans,
      and a woman&rsquo;s portrait. From all of this it was assumed that I was that
      Lesperon. Upon my return to consciousness your father greeted me
      effusively, whereat I wondered; he passed on to discuss&mdash;nay, to tell
      me of&mdash;the state of the province and of his own connection with the
      rebels, until I lay gasping at his egregious temerity. Then, when he
      greeted me as Monsieur de Lesperon, I had the explanation of it, but too
      late. Could I deny the identity then? Could I tell him that I was
      Bardelys, the favourite of the King himself? What would have occurred? I
      ask you, mademoiselle. Would I not have been accounted a spy, and would
      they not have made short work of me here at your chateau?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; they would have done no murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, but I could not be sure just then. Most men situated as your
      father was would have despatched me. Ah, mademoiselle, have you not proofs
      enough? Do you not believe me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, monsieur,&rdquo; she answered simply, &ldquo;I believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not believe, then, in the sincerity of my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no rely. Her face was averted, but from her silence I took heart.
      I drew close to her. I set my hand upon the tall back of her chair, and,
      leaning towards her, I spoke with passionate heat as must have melted, I
      thought, any woman who had not a loathing for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle; I am a poor man now,&rdquo; I ended. &ldquo;I am no longer that
      magnificent gentleman whose wealth and splendour were a byword. Yet am I
      no needy adventurer. I have a little property at Beaugency&mdash;a very
      spot for happiness, mademoiselle. Paris shall know me no more. At
      Beaugency I shall live at peace, in seclusion, and, so that you come with
      me, in such joy as in all my life I have done nothing to deserve. I have
      no longer an army of retainers. A couple of men and a maid or two shall
      constitute our household. Yet I shall account my wealth well lost if for
      love&rsquo;s sake you&rsquo;ll share with me the peace of my obscurity. I am poor,
      mademoiselle yet no poorer even now than that Gascon gentleman, Rene de
      Lesperon, for whom you held me, and on whom you bestowed the priceless
      treasure of your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, might it have pleased God that you had remained that poor Gascon
      gentleman!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what am I different, Roxalanne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that he had laid no wager,&rdquo; she answered, rising suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hopes were withering. She was not angry. She was pale, and her gentle
      face was troubled&mdash;dear God! how sorely troubled! To me it almost
      seemed that I had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flashed me a glance of her blue eyes, and I thought that tears
      impended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne!&rdquo; I supplicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she recovered the control that for a moment she had appeared upon the
      verge of losing. She put forth her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, monsieur!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced from her hand to her face. Her attitude began to anger me, for I
      saw that she was not only resisting me, but resisting herself. In her
      heart the insidious canker of doubt persisted. She knew&mdash;or should
      have known&mdash;that it no longer should have any place there, yet
      obstinately she refrained from plucking it out. There was that wager. But
      for that same obstinacy she must have realized the reason of my arguments,
      the irrefutable logic of my payment. She denied me, and in denying me she
      denied herself, for that she had loved me she had herself told me, and
      that she could love me again I was assured, if she would but see the thing
      in the light of reason and of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne, I did not come to Lavedan to say &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to you. I seek
      from you a welcome, not a dismissal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet my dismissal is all that I can give. Will you not take my hand? May
      we not part in friendly spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we may not; for we do not part at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was as the steel of my determination striking upon the flint of hers.
      She looked up to my face for an instant; she raised her eyebrows in
      deprecation; she sighed, shrugged one shoulder, and, turning on her heel,
      moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anatole shall bring you refreshment ere you go,&rdquo; she said in a very
      polite and formal voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I played my last card. Was it for nothing that I had flung away my
      wealth? If she would not give herself, by God, I would compel her to sell
      herself. And I took no shame in doing it, for by doing it I was saving her
      and saving myself from a life of unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roxalanne!&rdquo; I cried. The imperiousness of my voice arrested and compelled
      her perhaps against her very will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo; said she, as demurely as you please.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are doing?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes&mdash;perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardieu, you do not. I will tell you. You are sending your father to the
      scaffold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned livid, her step faltered, and she leant against the frame of
      the doorway for support. Then she stared at me, wide-eyed in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; she pleaded, yet without conviction. &ldquo;He is not in
      danger of his life. They can prove nothing against him. Monsieur de
      Saint-Eustache could find no evidence here&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet there is Monsieur de Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s word; there is the fact&mdash;the
      significant fact&mdash;that your father did not take up arms for the King,
      to afford the Chevalier&rsquo;s accusation some measure of corroboration. At
      Toulouse in these times they are not particular. Remember how it had fared
      with me but for the King&rsquo;s timely arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That smote home. The last shred of her strength fell from her. A great sob
      shook her, then covering her face with her hands &ldquo;Mother in heaven, have
      pity on me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, it cannot be, it cannot be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her distress touched me sorely. I would have consoled her, I would have
      bidden her have no fear, assuring her that I would save her father. But
      for my own ends, I curbed the mood. I would use this as a cudgel to
      shatter her obstinacy, and I prayed that God might forgive me if I did
      aught that a gentleman should account unworthy. My need was urgent, my
      love all-engrossing; winning her meant winning life and happiness, and
      already I had sacrificed so much. Her cry rang still in my ears, &ldquo;It
      cannot be, it cannot be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I trampled my nascent tenderness underfoot, and in its room I set a
      harshness that I did not feel&mdash;a harshness of defiance and menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be, it will be, and, as God lives, it shall be, if you persist in
      your unreasonable attitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, have mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when you shall be pleased to show me the way to it by having mercy
      upon me. If I have sinned, I have atoned. But that is a closed question
      now; to reopen it were futile. Take heed of this, Roxalanne: there is one
      thing&mdash;one only in all France can save your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, monsieur?&rdquo; she inquired breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word against that of Saint-Eustache. My indication to His Majesty that
      your father&rsquo;s treason is not to be accepted on the accusation of
      Saint-Eustache. My information to the King of what I know touching this
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go, monsieur?&rdquo; she implored me. &ldquo;Oh, you will save him! Mon
      Dieu, to think of the time that we have wasted here, you and I, whilst he
      is being carried to the scaffold! Oh, I did not dream it was so perilous
      with him! I was desolated by his arrest; I thought of some months&rsquo; 
      imprisonment, perhaps. But that he should die&mdash;! Monsieur de
      Bardelys, you will save him! Say that you will do this for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was on her knees to me now, her arms clasping my boots, her eyes
      raised in entreaty&mdash;God, what entreaty!&mdash;to my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, mademoiselle, I beseech you,&rdquo; I said, with a quiet I was far from
      feeling. &ldquo;There is no need for this. Let us be calm. The danger to your
      father is not so imminent. We may have some days yet&mdash;three or four,
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lifted her gently and led her to a chair. I was hard put to it not to
      hold her supported in my arms. But I might not cull that advantage from
      her distress. A singular niceness, you will say, perhaps, as in your scorn
      you laugh at me. Perhaps you are right to laugh&mdash;yet are you not
      altogether right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go to Toulouse, monsieur?&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a turn in the room, then halting before her &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I
      will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gratitude that leapt to her eyes smote me hard, for my sentence was
      unfinished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; I continued quickly, &ldquo;when you shall have promised to become
      my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The joy passed from her face. She glanced at me a moment as if without
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to Lavedan to win you, Roxalanne, and from Lavedan I shall not
      stir until I have accomplished my design,&rdquo; I said very quietly. &ldquo;You will
      therefore see that it rests with you how soon I may set out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell to weeping softly, but answered nothing. At last I turned from
      her and moved towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take the air, mademoiselle. If upon deliberation you can bring
      yourself to marry me, send me word by Anatole or one of the others, and I
      shall set out at once for Toulouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried. Obediently I stopped, my hand already upon the
      doorknob. &ldquo;You are cruel, monsieur!&rdquo; she complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; said I, by way of explaining it. &ldquo;To be cruel seems to be
      the way of love. You have been cruel to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you&mdash;would you take what is not freely given?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the hope that when you see that you must give, you will give
      freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;if I make you this promise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I was growing white with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will fulfil your part of the bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a habit of mine, mademoiselle&mdash;as witnesses the case of
      Chatellerault.&rdquo; She shivered at the mention of his name. It reminded her
      of precisely such another bargain that three nights ago she had made.
      Precisely, did I say? Well, not quite precisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I promise to marry you, then,&rdquo; said she in a choking voice,
      &ldquo;whenever you choose, after my father shall have been set at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed. &ldquo;I shall start at once,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps out of shame, perhaps out of&mdash;who shall say what
      sentiments?&mdash;I turned without another word and left her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE &ldquo;BRAVI&rdquo; AT BLAGNAC
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was glad to be in the open once more&mdash;glad of the movement, as I
      rode at the head of my brave company along the bank of the Garonne and in
      the shade of the golden, autumn-tinted trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in a measure angry with myself that I had driven such a bargain with
      Roxalanne, in a measure angry with her that she had forced me to it by her
      obstinacy. A fine gentleman I, on my soul, to have dubbed Chatellerault a
      cheat for having done no worse than I had now brought myself to do! Yet,
      was it so? No, I assured myself, it was not. A thousand times no! What I
      had done I had done as much to win Roxalanne to me as to win her from her
      own unreasonableness. In the days to come she should thank me for my
      harshness, for that which now she perhaps accounted my unfairness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, again, would I ask myself, was I very sure of this? And so the two
      questions were flung the one against the other; my conscience divided
      itself into two parties, and they waged a war that filled me with a
      depressing uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end shame was overthrown, and I flung back my head with a snort of
      assurance. I was doing no wrong. On the contrary, I was doing right&mdash;both
      by myself and by Roxalanne. What matter that I was really cheating her?
      What matter that I had said I would not leave Lavedan until I had her
      promise, whilst in reality I had hurled my threat at Saint-Eustache that I
      would meet him at Toulouse, and passed my word to the Vicomtesse that I
      would succour her husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave no thought to the hidden threat with which Saint-Eustache had
      retorted that from Lavedan to Toulouse was a distance of some twenty
      leagues. Had he been a man of sterner purposes I might have been uneasy
      and on my guard. But Saint-Eustache pshaw!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is ill to underestimate an enemy, be he never so contemptible, and for
      my disdain of the Chevalier I might have paid dearly had not Fortune&mdash;which
      of late had been practising singular jests upon me after seemingly
      abandoning me, returned to my aid at the last moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s purpose that I should never reach Toulouse alive,
      for in all the world I was the one man he feared, the one man who would
      encompass his undoing and destruction by a word. And so he had resolved
      and disposed that I should be removed, and to accomplish this he had left
      a line of bravi along the road I was to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had counted upon my lying the night in one of the intervening towns,
      for the journey was over-long to be accomplished at a stretch, and
      wherever I might chance to lie, there I should have to reckon with his
      assassins. The nearer Toulouse&mdash;although I knew not this&mdash;the
      thicker grew my danger. Into the very thick of it I rode; in the very
      thick of it I lay, and all that came of it was that I obtained possession
      of one more and overwhelming piece of evidence against my murderous
      Chevalier. But I outrun my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been my purpose to change horses at Grenade, and so push on and
      reach Toulouse that very night or in the early hours of the following
      morning. At Grenade, however, there were no horses to be obtained, at
      least not more than three, and so, leaving the greater portion of my
      company behind, I set out, escorted only by Gilles and Antoine. Night had
      fallen long before we reached Lespinasse, and with it came foul weather.
      The wind rose from the west, grew to the violence of a hurricane, and
      brought with it such a deluge of cold, cutting rain as never had it been
      my ill-chance to ride through. From Lespinasse to Fenouillet the road dips
      frequently, and wherever this occurred it seemed to us that we were riding
      in a torrent, our horses fetlock-deep in mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine complained in groans; Gilles growled openly, and went the length
      of begging me, as we rode through the ill-paved, flooded streets of
      Fenouillet, to go no farther. But I was adamant in my resolve. Soaked to
      the skin, my clothes hanging sodden about me, and chilled to the marrow
      though I was, I set my chattering teeth, and swore that we should not
      sleep until we reached Toulouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;and we but halfway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; was all I answered; and so as midnight chimed we left
      Fenouillet behind us, and dashed on into the open country and the full
      fury of the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      My servants came after me upon their stumbling horses, whining and cursing
      by turns, and forgetting in their misery the respect that they were
      accustomed to pay me. I think now that it was a providence that guided me.
      Had I halted at Fenouillet, as they would have had me do, it is odds that
      this chronicle would never have been penned, for likely enough I had had
      my throat cut as I slept. A providence was it also that brought my horse
      down within a half-mile of Blagnac, and so badly did it founder that it
      might not be ridden farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beasts my men bestrode were in little better condition, and so, with
      infinite chagrin, I was forced to acknowledge defeat and to determine that
      at Blagnac we should lie for the remainder of the night. After all, it
      mattered little. A couple of hours&rsquo; riding in the morning would bring us
      to Toulouse, and we would start betimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bade Gilles dismount&mdash;he had been the louder in his complainings&mdash;and
      follow us afoot, bringing my horse to the Auberge de l&rsquo;Etoile at Blagnac,
      where he would await him. Then I mounted his jaded beast, and, accompanied
      by Antoine&mdash;the last of my retainers&mdash;I rode into Blagnac, and
      pulled up at the sign of the &ldquo;Star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With my whip I smote the door, and I had need to smite hard if I would be
      heard above the wind that shrieked and howled under the eaves of that
      narrow street. Yet it almost seemed as if some one were expected, for
      scarce had my knocking ceased when the door was opened, and the landlord
      stood there, shading a taper with his hand. For a moment I saw the glow of
      its light on his rosy, white-bearded face, then a gust of wind
      extinguished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable!&rdquo; he swore, &ldquo;an ugly night for travelling&rdquo;; adding as an
      afterthought, &ldquo;You ride late, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man of supreme discernment, Monsieur l&rsquo;Hote,&rdquo; said I testily,
      as I pushed him aside and stepped into the passage. &ldquo;Will you keep me in
      the rain till daylight whilst you perpend how late I ride? Is your ostler
      abed? See to those beasts yourself, then. Afterwards get me food&mdash;for
      me and for my man and beds for both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have but one room, monsieur,&rdquo; he answered respectfully. &ldquo;You shall have
      that, and your servant shall sleep in the hayloft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My servant sleeps in my room, if you have but one. Set a mattress on the
      floor for him. Is this a night to leave a dog to sleep in a hayloft? I
      have another servant following. He will be here in a few minutes. You must
      find room for him also&mdash;in the passage outside my door, if no other
      accommodation be possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; he began in a tone of protest, which I set down to
      the way a landlord has of making difficulties that he shall be the better
      paid for such lodging as he finds us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See to it,&rdquo; I ordered peremptorily. &ldquo;You shall be well paid. Now go tend
      those horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the wall of the passage fell a warm, reddish glow from the common room,
      which argued a fire, and this was too alluring to admit of my remaining
      longer in discussion with him. I strode forward, therefore. The Auberge de
      l&rsquo;Etoile was not an imposing hostelry, nor one at which from choice I had
      made a halt. This common room stank most vilely of oil, of burning tallow&mdash;from
      the smoky tapers&mdash;and of I know not what other noisome
      unsavourinesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I entered, I was greeted by a resonant snore from a man seated in a
      corner by the fire. His head had fallen back, displaying the brown, sinewy
      neck, and he slept&mdash;or seemed to sleep&mdash;with mouth wide open.
      Full length on the hearth and in the red glare of the burning logs lay
      what at first glance I took to be a heap of rags, but which closer
      scrutiny showed me to be another man, seemingly asleep also.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flung my sodden castor on the table; I dropped my drenched cloak on the
      ground, and stepped with heavy tread and a noisy rattle of spurs across
      the floor. Yet my ragged gentleman slept on. I touched him lightly with my
      whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold, mon bonhomme!&rdquo; I cried to him. Still he did not move, whereat I
      lost patience and caught him a kick full in the side, so choicely aimed
      that first it doubled him up, then brought him into a sitting posture,
      with the snarl of a cross-grained dog that has been rudely aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      From out of an evil, dirty countenance a pair of gloomy, bloodshot eyes
      scowled threateningly upon me. The man on the chair awoke at the same
      instant, and sat forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh bien?&rdquo; said I to my friend on the hearth: &ldquo;Will you stir yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Is not the Etoile as much for me as for you,
      whoever you may be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have paid our lodging, pardieu!&rdquo; swore he of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My masters,&rdquo; said I grimly, &ldquo;if you have not eyes to see my sodden
      condition, and if you therefore have not the grace to move that I may
      approach the fire; I&rsquo;ll see to it that you spend the night not only a
      l&rsquo;Etoile, but a la belle etoile.&rdquo; With which pleasantry, and a touch of
      the foot, I moved my friend aside. My tone was not nice, nor do I
      generally have the air of promising more than I can fulfil.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were growling together in a corner when Antoine came to draw off my
      doublet and my boots. They were still growling when Gilles joined us
      presently, although at his coming they paused to take his measure with
      their eyes. For Gilles was something of a giant, and men were wont to turn
      their heads&mdash;aye, and women too&mdash;to admire his fine proportions.
      We supped&mdash;so vilely that I have not the heart to tell you what we
      ate&mdash;and, having supped, I bade my host light me to my chamber. As
      for my men, I had determined that they should spend the night in the
      common room, where there was a fire, and where&mdash;notwithstanding the
      company of those two ruffians, into whose presence I had not troubled to
      inquire&mdash;they would doubtless be better than elsewhere in that poor
      hostelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In gathering up my cloak and doublet and other effects to bear them off to
      the kitchen, the host would have possessed himself also of my sword. But
      with a laugh I took it from him, remarking that it required no drying.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we mounted the stairs, I heard something above me that sounded like the
      creaking of a door. The host heard it also, for he stood suddenly still,
      his glance very questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind, I should say,&rdquo; I answered idly; and my answer seemed to
      reassure him, for with a &ldquo;Ah, yes&mdash;the wind,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for all that I am far from being a man of tremors or unwarranted
      fears, to tell the truth the hostelry of the &ldquo;Star&rdquo; was beginning to fret
      my nerves. I could scarce have told you why had you asked me, as I sat
      upon the bed after mine host had left me, and turned my thoughts to it. It
      was none of the trivial incidents that had marked my coming; but it was, I
      think, the combination of them all. First there was the host&rsquo;s desire to
      separate me from my men by suggesting that they should sleep in the
      hayloft. Clearly unnecessary, when he was not averse to turning his common
      room into a dormitory. There was his very evident relief when, after
      announcing that I would have them sleep one in my room and one in the
      passage by my door, I consented to their spending the night below; there
      was the presence of those two very ill-looking cut-throats; there was the
      attempt to carry off my sword; and, lastly, there was that creaking door
      and the host&rsquo;s note of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood up suddenly. Had my fancy, dwelling upon that very incident,
      tricked me into believing that a door had creaked again? I listened, but a
      silence followed, broken only by a drone of voices ascending from the
      common room. As I had assured the host upon the stairs, so I now assured
      myself that it was the wind, the signboard of the inn, perhaps, swaying in
      the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when I had almost dismissed my doubts, and was about to divest
      myself of my remaining clothes, I saw something at which I thanked Heaven
      that I had not allowed the landlord to carry off my rapier. My eyes were
      on the door, and, as I gazed, I beheld the slow raising of the latch. It
      was no delusion; my wits were keen and my eyes sharp; there was no fear to
      make me see things that were not. Softly I stepped to the bed-rail where I
      had hung my sword by the baldrick, and as softly I unsheathed it. The door
      was pushed open, and I caught the advance of a stealthy step. A naked foot
      shot past the edge of the door into my room, and for a second I thought of
      pinning it to the ground with my rapier; then came a leg, then a
      half-dressed body surmounted by a face&mdash;the face of Rodenard!
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of it, amazement and a hundred suspicions crossed my mind. How,
      in God&rsquo;s name, came he here, and for what purpose did he steal so into my
      chamber?
    </p>
    <p>
      But my suspicions perished even as they were begotten. There was so
      momentous, so alarmingly warning a look on his face as he whispered the
      one word &ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; that clearly if danger there was to me it was not
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&mdash;&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the sound of my voice the alarm grew in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; he whispered, his finger on his lips. &ldquo;Be silent, monseigneur, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very softly he closed the door; softly, yet painfully, he hobbled forward
      to my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a plot to murder you, monseigneur,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Here at Blagnac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;You rave, man. Who was to know that I was to come this
      way? And who is there to plot against my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Saint-Eustache.&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for the rest, as to expecting you here, they did not, but they were
      prepared against the remote chance of your coming. From what I have
      gathered, there is not a hostelry betwixt this and Lavedan at which the
      Chevalier has not left his cutthroats with the promise of enormous reward
      to the men who shall kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught my breath at that. My doubts vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you know,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Be brief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon this faithful dog, whom I had so sorely beaten but four nights
      ago, told me how, upon finding himself able to walk once more, he had gone
      to seek me out, that he might implore me to forgive him and not cast him
      off altogether, after a lifetime spent in the service of my father and of
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had discovered from Monsieur de Castelroux that I was gone to Lavedan,
      and he determined to follow me thither. He had no horse and little money,
      and so he had set out afoot that very day, and dragged himself as far as
      Blagnac, where, however, his strength had given out, and he was forced to
      halt. A providence it seemed that this had so befallen. For here at the
      Etoile he had that evening overheard Saint-Eustache in conversation with
      those two bravi below stairs. It would seem from what he had said that at
      every hostelry from Grenade to Toulouse&mdash;at which it was conceivable
      that I might spend the night&mdash;the Chevalier had made a similar
      provision.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Blagnac, if I got so far without halting, I must arrive very late, and
      therefore the Chevalier had bidden his men await me until daylight. He did
      not believe, however, that I should travel so far, for he had seen to it
      that I should find no horses at the posthouses. But it was just possible
      that I might, nevertheless, push on, and Saint-Eustache would let no
      possibility be overlooked. Here at Blagnac the landlord, Rodenard informed
      me, was also in Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s pay. Their intention was to stab me as I
      slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; he ended, &ldquo;knowing what danger awaited you along the road,
      I have sat up all night, praying God and His saints that you might come
      this far, and that thus I might warn you. Had I been less bruised and
      sore, I had got myself a horse and ridden out to meet you; as it was, I
      could but hope and pray that you would reach Blagnac, and that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gathered him into my arms at that, but my embrace drew a groan from him,
      for the poor, faithful knave was very sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Ganymede!&rdquo; I murmured, and I was more truly moved to sympathy, I
      think, than ever I had been in all my selfish life. Hearing his sobriquet,
      a look of hope gleamed suddenly in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take me back, monseigneur?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You will take me back,
      will you not? I swear that I will never let my tongue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh, my good Ganymede. Not only will I take you back, but I shall strive
      to make amends for my brutality. Come, my friend, you shall have twenty
      golden Louis to buy unguents for your poor shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur is very good,&rdquo; he murmured, whereupon I would have embraced
      him again but that he shivered and drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, monseigneur,&rdquo; he whispered fearfully. &ldquo;It is a great honour, but
      it&mdash;it pains me to be touched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take the will for the deed. And now for these gentlemen below
      stairs.&rdquo; I rose and moved to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order Gilles to beat their brains out,&rdquo; was Ganymede&rsquo;s merciful
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head. &ldquo;We might be detained for doing murder. We have no proof
      yet of their intentions&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo; An idea flashed suddenly
      across my mind. &ldquo;Go back to your room, Ganymede,&rdquo; I bade him. &ldquo;Lock
      yourself in, and do not stir until I call you. I do not wish their
      suspicions aroused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door, and as Ganymede obediently slipped past me and vanished
      down the passage &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Hote,&rdquo; I called. &ldquo;Ho, there, Gilles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; answered the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; replied Gilles; and there came a stir below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is aught amiss?&rdquo; the landlord questioned, a note of concern in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amiss?&rdquo; I echoed peevishly, mincing my words as I uttered them. &ldquo;Pardi!
      Must I be put to it to undress myself, whilst those two lazy dogs of mine
      are snoring beneath me? Come up this instant, Gilles. And,&rdquo; I added as an
      afterthought, &ldquo;you had best sleep here in my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once, monseigneur,&rdquo; answered he, but I caught the faintest tinge of
      surprise in his accents, for never yet had it fallen to the lot of sturdy,
      clumsy Gilles to assist me at my toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord muttered something, and I heard Gilles whispering his reply.
      Then the stairs creaked under his heavy tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my room I told him in half a dozen words what was afoot. For answer, he
      swore a great oath that the landlord had mulled a stoup of wine for him,
      which he never doubted now was drugged. I bade him go below and fetch the
      wine, telling the landlord that I, too had a fancy for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of Antoine?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;They will drug him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them. We can manage this affair, you and I, without his help. If they
      did not drug him, they might haply stab him. So that in being drugged lies
      his safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I bade him so he did, and presently he returned with a great steaming
      measure. This I emptied into a ewer, then returned it to him that he might
      take it back to the host with my thanks and our appreciation. Thus should
      we give them confidence that the way was clear and smooth for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter there befell precisely that which already you will be
      expecting, and nothing that you cannot guess. It was perhaps at the end of
      an hour&rsquo;s silent waiting that one of them came. We had left the door
      unbarred so that his entrance was unhampered. But scarce was he within
      when out of the dark, on either side of him, rose Gilles and I. Before he
      had realized it, he was lifted off his feet and deposited upon the bed
      without a cry; the only sound being the tinkle of the knife that dropped
      from his suddenly unnerved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the bed, with Gilles&rsquo;s great knee in his stomach, and Gilles&rsquo;s hands at
      his throat, he was assured in unequivocal terms that at his slightest
      outcry we would make an end of him. I kindled a light. We trussed him hand
      and foot with the bedclothes, and then, whilst he lay impotent and silent
      in his terror, I proceeded to discuss the situation with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pointed out that we knew that what he had done he had done at
      Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s instigation, therefore the true guilt was
      Saint-Eustache&rsquo;s and upon him alone the punishment should fall. But ere
      this could come to pass, he himself must add his testimony to ours&mdash;mine
      and Rodenard&rsquo;s. If he would come to Toulouse and do that make a full
      confession of how he had been set to do this murdering&mdash;the Chevalier
      de Saint-Eustache, who was the real culprit, should be the only one to
      suffer the penalty of the law. If he would not do that, why, then, he must
      stand the consequences himself&mdash;and the consequences would be the
      hangman. But in either case he was coming to Toulouse in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It goes without saying that he was reasonable. I never for a moment held
      his judgment in doubt; there is no loyalty about a cut-throat, and it is
      not the way of his calling to take unnecessary risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had just settled the matter in a mutually agreeable manner when the
      door opened again, and his confederate&mdash;rendered uneasy, no doubt, by
      his long absence&mdash;came to see what could be occasioning this
      unconscionable delay in the slitting of the throats of a pair of sleeping
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beholding us there in friendly conclave, and no doubt considering that
      under the circumstances his intrusion was nothing short of an
      impertinence, that polite gentleman uttered a cry&mdash;which I should
      like to think was an apology for having disturbed us and turned to go with
      most indecorous precipitancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gilles took him by the nape of his dirty neck and haled him back into
      the room. In less time than it takes me to tell of it, he lay beside his
      colleague, and was being asked whether he did not think that he might also
      come to take the same view of the situation. Overjoyed that we intended no
      worse by him, he swore by every saint in the calendar that he would do our
      will, that he had reluctantly undertaken the Chevalier&rsquo;s business, that he
      was no cut-throat, but a poor man with a wife and children to provide for.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that, in short, was how it came to pass that the Chevalier de
      Saint-Eustache himself, by disposing for my destruction, disposed only for
      his own. With these two witnesses, and Rodenard to swear how
      Saint-Eustache had bribed them to cut my throat, with myself and Gilles to
      swear how the attempt had been made and frustrated, I could now go to His
      Majesty with a very full confidence, not only of having the Chevalier&rsquo;s
      accusations, against whomsoever they might be, discredited, but also of
      sending the Chevalier himself to the gallows he had so richly earned.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. LOUIS THE JUST
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;these depositions were not necessary. Your word,
      my dear Marcel, would have sufficed. For the courts, however, perhaps it
      is well that you have had them taken; moreover, they form a valuable
      corroboration of the treason which you lay to the charge of Monsieur de
      Saint-Eustache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were standing&mdash;at least, La Fosse and I were standing, Louis XIII
      sat&mdash;in a room, of the Palace of Toulouse, where I had had the honour
      of being brought before His Majesty. La Fosse was there, because it would
      seem that the King had grown fond of him, and could not be without him
      since his coming to Toulouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty was, as usual, so dull and weary&mdash;not even roused by the
      approaching trial of Montmorency, which was the main business that had
      brought him South that even the company of this vapid, shallow, but
      irrepressibly good-humoured La Fosse, with his everlasting mythology,
      proved a thing desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see,&rdquo; said Louis, &ldquo;that your friend the Chevalier is placed under
      arrest at once, and as much for his attempt upon your life as for the
      unstable quality of his political opinions, the law shall deal with him&mdash;conclusively.&rdquo;
       He sighed. &ldquo;It always pains me to proceed to extremes against a man of his
      stamp. To deprive a fool of his head seems a work of supererogation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I inclined my head, and smiled at his pleasantry. Louis the just rarely
      permitted himself to jest, and when he did his humour was as like unto
      humour as water is like unto wine. Still, when a monarch jests, if you are
      wise, if you have a favour to sue, or a position at Court to seek or to
      maintain, you smile, for all that the ineptitude of his witless wit be
      rather provocative of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nature needs meddling with at times,&rdquo; hazarded La Fosse, from behind His
      Majesty&rsquo;s chair. &ldquo;This Saint-Eustache is a sort of Pandora&rsquo;s box, which it
      is well to close ere&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil,&rdquo; said the King shortly. &ldquo;We are not jesting. We have to
      do justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Justice,&rdquo; murmured La Fosse; &ldquo;I have seen pictures of the lady. She
      covers her eyes with a bandage, but is less discreet where the other
      beauties of her figure are in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Majesty blushed. He was above all things a chaste-minded man, modest
      as a nun. To the immodesty rampant about him he was in the habit of
      closing his eyes and his ears, until the flagrancy or the noise of it grew
      to proportions to which he might remain neither blind nor deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de la Fosse,&rdquo; said he in an austere voice, &ldquo;you weary me, and
      when people weary me I send them away&mdash;which is one of the reasons
      why I am usually so much alone. I beg that you will glance at that
      hunting-book, so that when I have done with Monsieur de Bardelys you may
      give me your impressions of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      La Fosse fell back, obedient but unabashed, and, moving to a table by the
      window, he opened the book Louis had pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Marcel, while that buffoon prepares to inform me that the book has
      been inspired by Diana herself, tell me what else you have to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naught else, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How naught? What of this Vicomte de Lavedan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely Your Majesty is satisfied that there is no charge&mdash;no heedful
      charge against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, but there is a charge&mdash;a very heedful one. And so far you have
      afforded me no proofs of his innocence to warrant my sanctioning his
      enlargement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought, Sire, that it would be unnecessary to advance proofs of
      his innocence until there were proofs of his guilt to be refuted. It is
      unusual, Your Majesty, to apprehend a gentleman so that he may show cause
      why he did not deserve such apprehension. The more usual course is to
      arrest him because there are proofs of his guilt to be preferred against
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louis combed his beard pensively, and his melancholy eyes grew thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice point, Marcel,&rdquo; said he, and he yawned. &ldquo;A nice point. You should
      have been a lawyer.&rdquo; Then, with an abrupt change of manner, &ldquo;Do you give
      me your word of honour that he is innocent?&rdquo; he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Your Majesty&rsquo;s judges offer proof of his guilt, I give you my word
      that I will tear that proof to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not an answer. Do you swear his innocence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know what he carries in his conscience?&rdquo; quoth I still fencing with
      the question. &ldquo;How can I give my word in such a matter? Ah, Sire, it is
      not for nothing that they call you Louis the Just,&rdquo; I pursued, adopting
      cajolery and presenting him with his own favourite phrase. &ldquo;You will never
      allow a man against whom there is no shred of evidence to be confined in
      prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there not?&rdquo; he questioned. Yet his tone grew gentler. History, he had
      promised himself, should know him as Louis the Just, and he would do
      naught that might jeopardize his claim to that proud title. &ldquo;There is the
      evidence of this Saint-Eustache!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would Your Majesty hang a dog upon the word of that double traitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! You are a great advocate, Marcel. You avoid answering questions; you
      turn questions aside by counter-questions.&rdquo; He seemed to be talking more
      to himself than tome. &ldquo;You are a much better advocate than the Vicomte&rsquo;s
      wife, for instance. She answers questions and has a temper&mdash;Ciel!
      what a temper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have seen the Vicomtesse?&rdquo; I exclaimed, and I grew cold with
      apprehension, knowing as I did the licence of that woman&rsquo;s tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen her?&rdquo; he echoed whimsically. &ldquo;I have seen her, heard her, well-nigh
      felt her. The air of this room is still disturbed as a consequence of her
      presence. She was here an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it seemed,&rdquo; lisped La Fosse, turning from his hunting-book, &ldquo;as if
      the three daughters of Acheron had quitted the domain of Pluto to take
      embodiment in a single woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have seen her,&rdquo; the King resumed as though La Fosse had not
      spoken, &ldquo;but she would not be denied. I heard her voice blaspheming in the
      antechamber when I refused to receive her; there was a commotion at my
      door; it was dashed open, and the Swiss who held it was hurled into my
      room here as though he had been a mannikin. Dieu! Since I have reigned in
      France I have not been the centre of so much commotion. She is a strong
      woman, Marcel the saints defend you hereafter, when she shall come to be
      your mother-in-law. In all France, I&rsquo;ll swear, her tongue is the only
      stouter thing than her arm. But she&rsquo;s a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say, Sire?&rdquo; I asked in my anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say? She swore&mdash;Ciel! how she did swear! Not a saint in the calendar
      would she let rest in peace; she dragged them all by turns from their
      chapter-rolls to bear witness to the truth of what she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That her husband was the foulest traitor out of hell. But that he was a
      fool with no wit of his own to make him accountable for what he did, and
      that out of folly he had gone astray. Upon those grounds she besought me
      to forgive him and let him go. When I told her that he must stand his
      trial, and that I could offer her but little hope of his acquittal, she
      told me things about myself, which in my conceit, and thanks to you
      flatterers who have surrounded me, I had never dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me I was ugly, sour-faced, and malformed; that I was
      priest-ridden and a fool; unlike my brother, who, she assured me, is a
      mirror of chivalry and manly perfections. She promised me that Heaven
      should never receive my soul, though I told my beads from now till
      Doomsday, and she prophesied for me a welcome among the damned when my
      time comes. What more she might have foretold I cannot say. She wearied me
      at last, for all her novelty, and I dismissed her&mdash;that is to say,&rdquo;
       he amended, &ldquo;I ordered four musketeers to carry her out. God pity you,
      Marcel, when you become her daughter&rsquo;s husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I had no heart to enter into his jocularity. This woman with her
      ungovernable passion and her rash tongue had destroyed everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no likelihood of being her daughter&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; I answered
      mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked up, and laughed. &ldquo;Down on your knees, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      render thanks to Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I shook my head very soberly. &ldquo;To Your Majesty it is a pleasing
      comedy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but to me, helas! it is nearer far to tragedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Marcel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may I not laugh a little? One grows so sad with
      being King of France! Tell me what vexes you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Lavedan has promised that she will marry me only when I
      have saved her father from the scaffold. I came to do it, very full of
      hope, Sire. But his wife has forestalled me and, seemingly, doomed him
      irrevocably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His glance fell; his countenance resumed its habitual gloom. Then he
      looked up again, and in the melancholy depths of his eyes I saw a gleam of
      something that was very like affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I love you, Marcel,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Were you my own son I
      could not love you more. You are a profligate, dissolute knave, and your
      scandals have rung in my ears more than once; yet you are different from
      these other fools, and at least you have never wearied me. To have done
      that is to have done something. I would not lose you, Marcel; as lose you
      I shall if you marry this rose of Languedoc, for I take it that she is too
      sweet a flower to let wither in the stale atmosphere of Courts. This man,
      this Vicomte de Lavedan, has earned his death. Why should I not let him
      die, since if he dies you will not wed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ask me why, Sire?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Because they call you Louis the Just,
      and because no king was ever more deserving of the title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He winced; he pursed his lips, and shot a glance at La Fosse, who was deep
      in the mysteries of his volume. Then he drew towards him a sheet of paper,
      and, taking a quill, he sat toying with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they call me the Just, I must let justice take its course,&rdquo; he
      answered presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I objected, with a sudden hope, &ldquo;the course of justice cannot lead
      to the headsman in the case of the Vicomte de Lavedan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; And his solemn eyes met mine across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he took no active part in the revolt. If he was a traitor, he was
      no more than a traitor at heart, and until a man commits a crime in deed
      he is not amenable to the law&rsquo;s rigour. His wife has made his defection
      clear; but it were unfair to punish him in the same measure as you punish
      those who bore arms against you, Sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he pondered. &ldquo;Well? What more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that not enough, Sire?&rdquo; I cried. My heart beat quickly, and my pulses
      throbbed with the suspense of that portentous moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head, dipped his pen and began to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What punishment would you have me mete out to him?&rdquo; he asked as he wrote.
      &ldquo;Come, Marcel, deal fairly with me, and deal fairly with him&mdash;for as
      you deal with him, so shall I deal with you through him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt myself paling in my excitement. &ldquo;There is banishment, Sire&mdash;it
      is usual in cases of treason that are not sufficiently flagrant to be
      punished by death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He wrote busily. &ldquo;Banishment for how long, Marcel? For his
      lifetime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Sire. That were too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my lifetime, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again that were too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyes and smiled. &ldquo;Ah! You turn prophet? Well, for how long,
      then? Come, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think five years&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years be it. Say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wrote on for a few moments; then he raised the sandbox and sprinkled
      the document.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens!&rdquo; he cried, as he dusted it and held it out to me. &ldquo;There is my
      warrant for the disposal of Monsieur le Vicomte Leon de Lavedan. He is to
      go into banishment for five years, but his estates shall suffer no
      sequestration, and at the end of that period he may return and enjoy them&mdash;we
      hope with better loyalty than in the past. Get them to execute that
      warrant at once, and see that the Vicomte starts to-day under escort for
      Spain. It will also be your warrant to Mademoiselle de Lavedan, and will
      afford proof to her that your mission has been successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire!&rdquo; I cried. And in my gratitude I could say no more, but I sank on my
      knee before him and raised his hand to my lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he in a fatherly voice. &ldquo;Go now, and be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I rose, he suddenly put up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma foi, I had all but forgotten, so much has Monsieur de Lavedan&rsquo;s fate
      preoccupied us.&rdquo; He picked up another paper from his table, and tossed it
      to me. It was my note of hand to Chatellerault for my Picardy estates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatellerault died this morning,&rdquo; the King pursued. &ldquo;He had been asking
      to see you, but when he was told that you had left Toulouse, he dictated a
      long confession of his misdeeds, which he sent to me together with this
      note of yours. He could not, he wrote, permit his heirs to enjoy your
      estates; he had not won them; he had really forfeited his own stakes,
      since he had broken the rules of play. He has left me to deliver judgment
      in the matter of his own lands passing into your possession. What do you
      say to it, Marcel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was almost with reluctance that I took up that scrap of paper. It had
      been so fine and heroic a thing to have cast my wealth to the winds of
      heaven for love&rsquo;s sake, that on my soul I was loath to see myself master
      of more than Beaugency. Then a compromise suggested itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wager, Sire,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is one that I take shame in having entered
      upon; that shame made me eager to pay it, although fully conscious that I
      had not lost. But even now, I cannot, in any case, accept the forfeit
      Chatellerault was willing to suffer. Shall we&mdash;shall we forget that
      the wager was ever laid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The decision does you honour. It was what I had hoped from you. Go now,
      Marcel. I doubt me you are eager. When your love-sickness wanes a little
      we shall hope to see you at Court again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sighed. &ldquo;Helas, Sire, that would be never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you said once before, monsieur. It is a foolish spirit upon which to
      enter into matrimony; yet&mdash;like many follies&mdash;a fine one. Adieu,
      Marcel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, Sire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had kissed his hands; I had poured forth my thanks; I had reached the
      door already, and he was in the act of turning to La Fosse, when it came
      into my head to glance at the warrant he had given me. He noticed this and
      my sudden halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is aught amiss?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-you have omitted something, Sire,&rdquo; I ventured, and I returned to the
      table. &ldquo;I am already so grateful that I hesitate to ask an additional
      favour. Yet it is but troubling you to add a few strokes of the pen, and
      it will not materially affect the sentence itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at me, and his brows drew together as he sought to guess my
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, man, what is it?&rdquo; he demanded impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has occurred to me that this poor Vicomte, in a strange land, alone,
      among strange faces, missing the loved ones that for so many years he has
      seen daily by his side, will be pitiably lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King&rsquo;s glance was lifted suddenly to my face. &ldquo;Must I then banish his
      family as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of it will not be necessary, Your Majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once his eyes lost their melancholy, and as hearty a burst of laughter
      as ever I heard from that poor, weary gentleman he vented then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ciel! what a jester you are! Ah, but I shall miss you!&rdquo; he cried, as,
      seizing the pen, he added the word I craved of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you content at last?&rdquo; he asked, returning the paper to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at it. The warrant now stipulated that Madame la Vicomtesse de
      Lavedan should bear her husband company in his exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, you are too good!&rdquo; I murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the officer to whom you entrust the execution of this warrant that
      he will find the lady in the guardroom below, where she is being detained,
      pending my pleasure. Did she but know that it was your pleasure she has
      been waiting upon, I should tremble for your future when the five years
      expire.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. WE UNSADDLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle held the royal warrant of her father&rsquo;s banishment in her
      hand. She was pale, and her greeting of me had been timid. I stood before
      her, and by the door stood Rodenard, whom I had bidden attend me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had approached Lavedan that day, I had been taken with a great, an
      overwhelming shame at the bargain I had driven. I had pondered, and it had
      come to me that she had been right to suggest that in matters of love what
      is not freely given it is not worth while to take. And out of my shame and
      that conclusion had sprung a new resolve. So that nothing might weaken it,
      and lest, after all, the sight of Roxalanne should bring me so to desire
      her that I might be tempted to override my purpose, I had deemed it well
      to have the restraint of a witness at our last interview. To this end had
      I bidden Ganymede follow me into the very salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read the document to the very end, then her glance was raised timidly
      again to mine, and from me it shifted to Ganymede, stiff at his post by
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the best that you could do, monsieur?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I answered calmly. &ldquo;I do not wish to
      magnify my service, but it was that or the scaffold. Madame your mother
      had, unfortunately, seen the King before me, and she had prejudiced your
      father&rsquo;s case by admitting him to be a traitor. There was a moment when in
      view of that I was almost led to despair. I am glad, however,
      mademoiselle, that I was so fortunate as to persuade the King to just so
      much clemency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for five years, then, I shall not see my parents.&rdquo; She sighed, and
      her distress was very touching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That need not be. Though they may not come to France, it still remains
      possible for you to visit them in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; she mused; &ldquo;that will be something&mdash;will it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly something; under the circumstances, much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed again, and for a moment there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not sit, monsieur?&rdquo; said she at last. She was very quiet to-day,
      this little maid&mdash;very quiet and very wondrously subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is scarce the need,&rdquo; I answered softly; whereupon her eyes were
      raised to ask a hundred questions. &ldquo;You are satisfied with my efforts,
      mademoiselle?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am satisfied, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the end, I told myself, and involuntarily I also sighed. Still, I
      made no shift to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are satisfied that I&mdash;that I have fulfilled what I promised?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were again cast down, and she took a step in the direction of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes. Your promise was to save my father from the scaffold. You have
      done so, and I make no doubt you have done as much to reduce the term of
      his banishment as lay within your power. Yes, monsieur, I am satisfied
      that your promise has been well fulfilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heigho! The resolve that I had formed in coming whispered it in my ear
      that nothing remained but to withdraw and go my way. Yet not for all that
      resolve&mdash;not for a hundred such resolves&mdash;could I have gone
      thus. One kindly word, one kindly glance at least would I take to comfort
      me. I would tell her in plain words of my purpose, and she should see that
      there was still some good, some sense of honour in me, and thus should
      esteem me after I was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganymede.&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid the men mount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that she turned, wonder opening her eyes very wide, and her glance
      travelled from me to Rodenard with its unspoken question. But even as she
      looked at him he bowed and, turning to do my bidding, left the room. We
      heard his steps pass with a jingle of spurs across the hall and out into
      the courtyard. We heard his raucous voice utter a word of command, and
      there was a stamping of hoofs, a cramping of harness, and all the bustle
      of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you ordered your men to mount?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my business here is ended, and we are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going?&rdquo; said she. Her eyes were lowered now, but a frown suggested their
      expression to me. &ldquo;Going whither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;That for the moment is all that signifies.&rdquo; I paused
      to swallow something that hindered a clear utterance. Then, &ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; said
      I, and I abruptly put forth my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance met mine fearlessly, if puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, monsieur, that you are leaving Lavedan&mdash;thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that I leave, what signifies the manner of my going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;the trouble grew in her eyes; her cheeks seemed to wax paler
      than they had been&mdash;&ldquo;but I thought that&mdash;that we made a
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sh! mademoiselle, I implore you,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I take shame at the memory
      of it. Almost as much shame as I take at the memory of that other bargain
      which first brought me to Lavedan. The shame of the former one I have
      wiped out&mdash;although, perchance, you think it not. I am wiping out the
      shame of the latter one. It was unworthy in me, mademoiselle, but I loved
      you so dearly that it seemed to me that no matter how I came by you, I
      should rest content if I but won you. I have since seen the error if it,
      the injustice of it. I will not take what is not freely given. And so,
      farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see,&rdquo; she murmured, and ignored the hand that I held out. &ldquo;I am
      very glad of it, monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I withdrew my hand sharply. I took up my hat from the chair on which I had
      cast it. She might have spared me that, I thought. She need not have
      professed joy. At least she might have taken my hand and parted in
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, mademoiselle!&rdquo; I said again, as stiffly as might be, and I turned
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; she called after me. I halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood demurely, with eyes downcast and hands folded. &ldquo;I shall be so
      lonely here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood still. I seemed to stiffen. My heart gave a mad throb of hope,
      then seemed to stop. What did she mean? I faced her fully once more, and,
      I doubt not, I was very pale. Yet lest vanity should befool me, I dared
      not act upon suspicions. And so &ldquo;True, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You will be
      lonely. I regret it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As silence followed, I turned again to the door, and my hopes sank with
      each step in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice arrested me upon the very threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall a poor girl do with this great estate upon her hands? It will
      go to ruin without a man to govern it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not attempt the task. You must employ an intendant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I caught something that sounded oddly like a sob. Could it be? Dieu! could
      it be, after all? Yet I would not presume. I half turned again, but her
      voice detained me. It came petulantly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Bardelys, you have kept your promise nobly. Will you ask no
      payment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mademoiselle,&rdquo; I answered very softly; &ldquo;I can take no payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were lifted for a second. Their blue depths seemed dim. Then they
      fell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why will you not help me?&rdquo; she burst out, to add more softly: &ldquo;I
      shall never be happy without you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean?&rdquo; I gasped, retracing a step, and flinging my hat in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I love you, Marcel&mdash;that I want you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can forgive&mdash;you can forgive?&rdquo; I cried, as I caught her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was a laugh that bespoke her scorn of everything&mdash;of
      everything save us two, of everything save our love. That and the pout of
      her red lips was her answer. And if the temptation of those lips&mdash;But
      there! I grow indiscreet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still holding her, I raised my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ganymede!&rdquo; I called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monseigneur?&rdquo; came his answer through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid those knaves dismount and unsaddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
